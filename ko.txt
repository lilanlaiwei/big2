dedication 


the medical profession is often spoken of as non progressive  as a
practical member of it  the author is of a different opinion  he knows
full well not only that  to many  age does not tend to make anything
medical more worthy of attention  but that the old is apt to be wilfully
overlooked  he discovered some time ago that in the library of the
college of physicians of philadelphia   the centre  probably  of medical
learning in the united states   adams    edition of the works of hippocrates
had rested with the leaves uncut for over twenty years  new things are
far too much in vogue  if bacon were alive to day he might still say 
with too much truth  as he said three hundred years ago     let a man look
into physicians    prescripts and ministrations and he will find them but
inconstancies and every day devices  without any settled providence or
project        advancement of learning      the age is too much one of trial 
of incoherency  to be either eminently scientific or highly successful
in practice  beyond question  the medicine of the past is harmfully
neglected  for its literature few have a desirable taste  and fewer yet
a sufficient knowledge  deploring this state of things  the author would
gladly assist in bringing about a change  hence  it affords him pleasure
to dedicate this essay to his professional brethren 




preface 


in this essay i have treated  as the title indicates  of medical
symbolism in connection with studies  essentially historical  in the
arts of healing and hygiene  some parts of it bear only indirectly on
the main subject  but they serve to render the whole more complete and
interesting  doubtless the reader will not be inclined to find much fault
with any of the apparent digressions 

in the score of chapters into which the essay is divided  attention
is invited to numerous more or less remarkable matters pertaining to
medicine  most of them of very ancient date  and some of practical
importance  medical mythology is treated of very fully  and  on this 
as indeed on all points  the results of the most recent arch  ological
and other investigations are given  all i have said is deserving  i
believe  of the consideration of educated physicians        the wise
man will seek out the wisdom of all the ancients     says the author of
   ecclesiasticus        one who had the tastes of a cultivated medical man 

although the essay is mainly on old things  i venture to hold that it
contains much which a fairly well read physician will find fresh  the
ground gone over has been little trodden before  it may be said  as
pliny did  by way of suggestion of difficulties to be overcome  when
he sat down to write his sketch of the history of the art of medicine 
   that no one has hitherto treated of this subject        but just as pliny
overlooked what celsus had done  and done well  so in this case  some
worthy author may have been overlooked  still  this is improbable  what
is here presented  and in part coherently  is gathered from manifold
sources  i have limited my references as much as possible to works in the
english language  or translations  the statements of authors are given in
their own words  but quotations of wearisome length have been avoided 

the possibility of research in respect to the themes treated of  and
allied ones  not being limited  the essay cannot be expected to be either
perfect or complete  whatever its merits or shortcomings may be  however 
it is an outcome of congenial studies pursued for their own sake  i
believe it contains a fund of information which deserves to be widely
known  the perusal of it may  at least  serve to excite an interest in
the ample literature and long and remarkable history of the benevolent
and learned profession of medicine 

                                                                  t  s  s 




biographical sketch of thomas s  sozinskey  m d   ph d 


thomas s  sozinskey  m d   ph d   the author of this interesting little
volume  was born in county derry  ireland  and died in the city of
philadelphia  april           in the thirty seventh year of his age 
he came to this country when seventeen years of age  and settled in
philadelphia  entering the university of pennsylvania some years later 
he graduated from that institution  and afterward began the study of
medicine  receiving the degree of doctor of medicine in the year       he
also received the degree of doctor of philosophy from the same faculty 

dr  sozinskey immediately entered upon his career as medical practitioner
in philadelphia  where he remained until his marriage to miss abby w 
johnson  a daughter of luke johnson  who was a descendant of one of the
founders of germantown 

shortly after his marriage dr  sozinskey decided to visit kansas city 
partly with the idea of locating there  but after a sojourn of about
one year in the west he returned to philadelphia  and began again the
practice of his chosen profession  succeeding in a few years in building
up a very extensive and lucrative practice in the northwestern section of
the city 

dr  sozinskey was a man highly intellectual  studious  and scholarly 
he was a frequent contributor to a number of leading medical journals 
as well as the author of several well known works  among which may be
mentioned    the care and culture of children     also  a little volume
entitled    personal appearance and the culture of beauty    

his last literary effort     medical symbolism     which is a work showing
a vast amount of research  was completed just before his death  he was
induced to undertake    medical symbolism    after the appearance of an
article bearing this title in the  medical and surgical reporter   which
attracted considerable attention  both in this country and in europe 

he received so many letters from men prominent in the medical profession 
suggesting that a book be written upon this subject  that the task was
undertaken 

by his untimely death three small children became orphans  the mother
having died one year earlier  after a short illness 

his readiness to attend the sick  regardless of compensation  greatly
endeared him to a large number of the poor 

containing  as it does  so much that is unique  and in a field not
often touched by previous writers     medical symbolism    is sure to
find appreciative readers  not only among the fraternity to which dr 
sozinskey belonged  but among the scientific and literary generally  and 
from the encouragement already received  the publishers feel confident of
a large and wide spread demand for this little volume 

                                                                  e  s  p

    dr  t  s  sozinskey 

    dear sir    please accept my thanks for your paper on    medical
    symbolism     received this morning  i have read it with great
    interest  more especially as it is in the direction of the
    higher education of physicians  the preponderance of the
    so called practical  empirical  in medical literature  which
    appeals strongly to the  trade  element in the profession 
    makes such a contribution all the more enjoyable 

                           very truly yours

    dear doctor    many thanks  you ought to enlarge the article to
    a little book  it interested me greatly  in a  bas relief  of
    myself by st  gaudens  new york  he has set beside the head the
    caduceus and twin serpents as symbolical  at all events  they
    will symbolize my relation to snakes 

                              yours truly

    dr  t  s  sozinskey 

    my dear doctor    i write to thank you for a copy of your
    interesting and instructive paper on    medical symbolism     in
    fergusson  on    tree and serpent worship     which you quote 
    you can readily trace the connection between the emblems
    of religion and medicine  i recognize that  as priest and
    physician were once the same person  medicine is yet justly
    termed    the divine art     it affords me much pleasure to see
    your studious interest in your profession 

                              yours truly

medical symbolism 




chapter i 

remarks on the meaning of symbols 


a symbol is an illustration of a thing which  to use a poetic phrase 
is    not what it seems     when a familiar object  or figure of any kind 
from some cause or other  has attached to it a meaning different from
the obvious and ordinary one  it is symbolic  thus  if one take a
poppy head to convey the idea of sleep  it is a symbol  one may regard
it as symbolic of sleep  or  if he choose  of hypnos  somnus   the god
of sleep  the illustration on the next page will afford a still more apt
example  to the eye  it appears to be simply a partly coiled serpent
resting on a pedestal  that is  in truth  what it is  but  regarded from
the stand point of the student of medical symbolism  it has another and
very different signification  before such a figure many a human being 
diseased and suffering  has bowed in reverence and piously offered to it
petitions for relief  to many a noble greek and haughty roman  indeed  to
generations of such  it was a god  the great god of    the divine art     as
medicine was often beautifully called in ancient times  the serpent is
the most important of medical symbols 

in any composite figure the elements of it are spoken of as  attributes  
and of these some are  essential  and some  conventional   the essential
ones only are  strictly speaking  symbols  thus  in a representation of
the goddess of liberty  the cap is not a symbol  it is a conventional
attribute  says the learned and distinguished historian of ancient
art  c  o  m  ller     the essence of the symbol consists in the supposed
real connections of the sign with the thing signified        in some
authoritative works  as  for instance  that of fairholt     the serpent
in medical art is said not to be a symbol  but this is not true if it be
taken to represent the god of medicine  which  as i have already stated 
was done by both greeks and romans  evidently  if taken as of this narrow
meaning  there are not many comprehensive medical symbols  but i will
take it in a wider sense  i will take it to mean any mystic figure or any
kind of attribute  in doing so i do no more than fairholt holds should
be done  referring to the words  symbol    image   and  allegorical
figure  as well as  attribute   he says     their shades of difference
are so slight that it would be most convenient to regard them all under
the general term  symbol         i may add these remarks of tiele     a
symbol is a simple or complex thought clothed in a sensuous form  a myth
is a phenomenon of nature represented as the act of a person  usually
symbols originate in myths  and in every case mythology is antecedent to
symbolism        there are many symbols  however  which never had anything
to do with myths  as will become evident later 

 illustration  fig       a medical symbol  

in the wide sense in which i propose to use it  symbol is almost or quite
synonymous with  emblem   as popularly used  mackenzie    and other
authorities  however  state that the word emblem is properly applicable
only to a mystic object or figure of two or more parts  thus  it is
more correct to speak of    a skull and cross bones    as emblematic than
symbolic of a poison or of death  again  while a serpent might properly
be called a symbol  one in connection with a staff is an emblem  in this
restricted sense  emblem is closely allied in meaning to  allegory  
but in an allegorical representation most of the elements of it are apt
to be symbolic  and beauty of the whole is a consideration  the great
epidaurian representation of   sculapius is an example  a simple image or
 statue  is essentially a symbol 

i need hardly say that any figure may or may not be a symbol  but a mere
 figure  is simply a representation of any object regarded as void of any
other than its ordinary meaning  a conventional representation of any
idea may be nothing more than a figure  in this sense  it is sometimes
called an  ideograph  




chapter ii 

the serpentine god of medicine at rome 


as i have already intimated  the god of medicine   that is 
  sculapius      was not only on familiar terms  so to speak  with the
serpent  but at times given a serpentine form  pausanias expressly
informs us that he often appeared in such singular shape      the visitor
to imperial rome about two thousand years ago saw this divinity in
reptilian guise an object of high regard and worship  it is worth while
to enter into a short study of the matter 

now  at the outset  i may observe that it is a noteworthy fact that in
their regard for medical men the early greeks and others contrasted
remarkably with the romans  the greeks would seem to have duly prized
the class  one has but to turn to homer to find evidence of the fact  a
passage suggested by machaon   s splendid exercise of his beneficent art 
spoken by idomeneus when the    offspring of the healing god    was wounded
by a dart fired by    the spouse of helen     paris   and    trembling greece
for her physician fear   d     runs    

       a wise physician skill   d our wounds to heal 
    is more than armies to the public weal        

cowper translates this interesting couplet more literally than pope    

       one so skill   d in medicine and to free
    the inherent barb is worth a multitude    

this is a very noble tribute to the physician  in fact  i know of but few
as good  among them being the one in    ecclesiasticus    which reads     the
skill of the physician shall lift up his head and in the sight of great
men he shall be praised         the latter is hebr  o egyptian in origin 
and its date is about two hundred years before our era  the early romans
did not look on doctors with any such favor     

it is a well known fact that the art of medicine was never very
enthusiastically or successfully cultivated by the romans  it was not
until a comparatively late date that medical practitioners existed
among them at all  pliny has left us some interesting notes on the
matter  after the statement that many nations have gotten along without
physicians  he says     such  for instance  was the roman people for a
period of more than six hundred years  a people  too  which has never
shown itself slow to adopt all useful arts  and which even welcomed the
medical art with avidity until  after a fair experience of it  there was
found good reason to condemn it         he himself was not a great friend
of it 

cato  who died in the year of the city of rome      said 
authoritatively     they  the greeks  have conspired among themselves
to murder all barbarians with their medicine  a profession which they
exercise for lucre  in order that they may win our confidence and
despatch us all the more easily  i forbid you to have anything to do with
physicians         notwithstanding this  the imperious old roman had not
a personal dislike to taking medicine     far from it  by hercules     says
pliny     for he subjoins an account of the medical prescriptions by the
aid of which he had ensured to himself and his wife a ripe old age        

it appears that the first physician who exercised his profession at rome
was    archagathus  the son of lysanias  who came over from peloponnessus
in the year of the city         he was kindly welcomed  and  from his
special line of practice  was called    vulnerarius     but  from cruelty
displayed    in cutting and searing his patients  he brought the art and
physicians into disrepute         it is this experience to which pliny
refers in the foregoing quotation 

there is reason to believe that the romans never regarded medicine as
an art appreciatively  they have transmitted to posterity little that
is original and valuable  besides what is found in pliny   s work  the
production of celsus     is about all that calls for special mention 
and it is possible that the latter  as well as the former  was only a
compiler  pliny significantly says     the art of medicine at the present
time even teaches us in numerous instances to have recourse to the
oracles for aid         he lived from    to    a d 

the roman people had no special god of medicine until the year    
b c  in the preceding year  the prevalence of a pestilence caused much
consternation  this led to a consultation of the delphian oracle  or 
according to livy  see page     the sibylline books  as to what should be
done  and the command of    the delphic oracle  or of the sibylline books    
to use the language of an authoritative work      was given  to send an
embassy to procure the aid of the grecian god of healing    sculapius 

the story of the bringing of   sculapius to rome  like that of the
bringing of cybele from pessinus in galatia  is an interesting one  and
must be known if one would fully appreciate the fact of the god being
given the serpentine form  the serpent being generally regarded as only
an attribute of him at his chief seat  the great epidaurian asclepion  or
temple of health  it is graphically told by ovid 

ovid begins his poem     with an invocation to the    melodious maids of
pindus     and  addressing them  continues    

       say  whence the isle which tiber flows around 
    its altars with a heavenly stranger grac   d 
    and in our shrines the god of physic plac   d    

we are then told that   

       a wasting plague infected latium   s skies 
       
    in vain were human remedies apply   d 
    weary   d with death  they seek celestial aid 
    and visit ph  bus in his delphic shade    

the reply of the oracle is this    

       relief must be implor   d and succour won
    not from apollo  but apollo   s son 
    my son to latium borne shall bring redress 
    go with good omens  and expect success    

the senate appointed an embassy to carry out the order    

       who sail to epidaurus    neighbouring land    

to it the god    sculapius  is represented as saying    

       i come and leave my shrine 
    this serpent view  that with ambitious play
    my staff encircles  mark him every way 
    his form  though larger  nobler  i   ll assume 
    and  changed as gods should be  bring aid to rome    

in due time    the salutary serpent      the god  reached the island of the
tiber and assumed again his form divine       

       and now no more the drooping city mourns 
    joy is again restor   d and health returns    

there is little or no reason to doubt that there was really a formal
bringing of   sculapius to rome  a cosmopolitan city which  indeed  as
gibbon states without much exaggeration  bestowed its freedom    on all
the gods of mankind         livy  the historian  speaks of the matter as
follows    

   the many prosperous events of the year       were scarcely sufficient to
afford consolation for one calamity  a pestilence  which afflicted both
the city and country and caused a prodigious mortality  to discover what
end or what remedy was appointed by the gods for that calamity  the books
were consulted  and there it was found that   sculapius must be brought
to rome from epidaurus  however  as the consuls had full employment
in the wars  no farther steps were taken in that business during this
year  except the performing of a supplication to   sculapius of one day   s
continence         elsewhere     he says that the god was brought the
following year    that is  a u c       or     b c 

the island of the tiber   insula tiberina   now  isola tiberina    the
    inter duos pontes     of the early centuries of our era  where   sculapius
was worshipped  and which was sometimes called by his name   insula
  sculapii    is within the limits of the city of rome  according to
tradition  it originated from alluvial accumulations within the period
of roman history      it is rather remarkable that  excepting the one at
the mouth   insula sacra   now  isola sacra    there is no other along
the whole course of the famous river  it is ship shaped  and quite small
in size  being only about a quarter of a mile in length      and has been
called    san bartolomeo     from the church which has long occupied the site
of the ancient temple of health      mr  davies speaks of it at length in
his interesting book  after an account of the origin of the worship of
  sculapius on it  he says    

   it was in commemoration of this event that the island was fashioned in
the form of a ship  huge blocks of travertine and peperino still remain
about the prow  pointing down the stream   imitating on a grand scale
the forms of the planks  upon which are chiseled the figure of a serpent
twined around a rod  and  farther down  the head of an ox  a temple was
raised to   sculapius  in which his statue was placed  which probably
stood in the fore part of the simulated vessel  hospitals for the sick
occupying the sides  a tall column or obelisk rising in the midst to
represent a mast  temples were also dedicated to jupiter and faunus     
to these were added a prison in the days of tiberius        

whether the establishment of the worship of the healing divinity on the
island at rome was brought about by chance  or deliberately  is not
very clear  pliny would seem to think that it was elsewhere at first
when he says     the temple of   sculapius  even after he was received as
a divinity  was built without the city and afterward on an island        
the abhorrence of the people for physicians is given as the reason for
isolating the institution  the noble romans had no love for a class that
made a trade of curing the sick  enriching themselves off the misfortunes
of their fellow men  they were shocked  says pliny     more particularly
that man should pay so dear for the enjoyment of life         there may
have been other and better reasons  the greeks themselves placed their
asclepia in rural and often insular places  thus  the great epidaurian
asclepion was in a secluded vale  and two very celebrated ones  those of
cos and rhodes  were  as the names indicate  on islands  it is needless
to say that there are excellent sanitary reasons for placing sanatory
institutions in the country  and especially on insular sites  it will be
a long step in the right direction when we somewhat unwise moderns cease
to have our medical institutions within the built up parts of our cities
and towns  and treat the sick  especially those affected with contagious
diseases  at a distance from the well 

devotion to the serpentine healer appears to have lingered long in
sunny italy      a bronze serpent in the basilica of st  ambrose was
worshipped as late as the year       but the precise import of it is not
known  referring to it  de gubernatis says     some say that it was the
serpent of   sculapius  others that of moses  others that it was an image
of christ  for us it is enough to remark here that it was a mythical
serpent before which milanese mothers brought their children when they
suffered from worms in order to relieve them  as we learn from the
depositions of the visit of san carlo borromeo to this basilica         san
carlo suppressed the superstitious practice     




chapter iii 

the   sculapian serpent 


it is not to be presumed that many in our day would seriously believe
that   sculapius assumed the form of a large serpent  in the famous
legendary voyage to rome  but it is hardly to be doubted  as i have
already remarked  that there was actually a serpent brought from
epidaurus on the occasion  it is very probable that the roman embassy
deliberately brought one with them  still  the coming of the reptile on
board the ship may have been accidental      the latter was the case 
according to one tradition  at any rate  there was sufficient ground
on which a superstitious people could easily construct a mythical
superstructure to please their fancy 

the assumption of the form of a serpent by the god of medicine was not an
extraordinary thing  according to ancient beliefs  plenty of instances
might be cited  i may give one  alexander the great was believed by many
to have been not the son of philip  but of jupiter ammon  who appeared to
olympias in reptilian shape  plutarch tells the story  it is amusingly
related of philip that    he lost one of his eyes as he applied it to the
chink of the door  when he saw the god  in the form of a serpent  in
his wife   s embraces         the ability to take on at pleasure any animal
or other form was regarded as one of the distinguishing prerogatives of
divinity 

taking it for granted  then  that there was really a serpent transferred
from epidaurus to rome  which was regarded as   sculapius  the interesting
question arises  of what species was it  a very conclusive answer may be
given 

it is known that at the epidaurian asclepion a species of serpent existed
in considerable numbers by permission  after stating that all serpents 
   but particularly those of a more yellow color  are considered as sacred
to   sculapius  and are gentle and harmless toward men     pausanias says 
   they are alone nourished in the land of the epidaurians  and i find
that the same circumstance takes place in other regions         here 
then  is proof that there was a species of serpent which deserved to be
characterized as   sculapian 

 illustration  fig       the   sculapian serpent  

it being reasonably certain that only one kind of serpent    was nourished
in the land of the epidaurians     and regarded as sacred to   sculapius 
the following passage from pliny is interesting     the   sculapian snake
was first brought to rome from epidaurus  but at the present day it is
very commonly reared  in our houses even  so much so  indeed  that  if
the breed were not kept down by the frequent conflagrations  it would
be impossible to make head against the rapid increase of them        
it is evident from this statement that the serpent in question was
not venomous  that its presence was prized  and that people would not
wilfully kill it 

now  a pretty species of oviparous  non venomous serpent  still common
in italy  is believed to be the      sculapian snake    of pliny  called
 paroas  by greek writers      i have examined a number of specimens 
several are to be seen in the museum of the academy of natural sciences 
philadelphia  it has been described by shaw under the name of  coluber
  sculapii   but it is now often called  elaphis   sculapii   a cut of it
is given in brehm   s great popular work      which is very good  except
that it gives one the impression that the animal is decidedly large  the
  sculapian serpent is comparatively small  being from three to four and
one half feet in length  and about as thick as a stout walking cane  it
is orange brown above  or  as shaw puts it     rufous colour on the upper
parts  more or less deep in different individuals         beneath it is of
a straw color  the scales of the back are oval and carinated  and those
of the sides are smooth  the tapering tail measures about nine inches 
movement takes place through vertical waves or swellings  it is very
active and can climb trees with facility  when attacked it will defend
itself  but it is by nature gentle and is easily tamed 

in his brief description of it  cuvier follows shaw  he adds     it is that
which the ancients have represented in their statues of   sculapius  and
it is probable that the serpent of epidaurus was of this species   the
 coluber   sculapii  of linn  us     is of a totally different species  and
belongs to america         

the   sculapian serpent is closely related to the ringed snake   natrix
torquata    the only british member of the family  and the common black
snake   coluber constrictor   of america is of the same genus  but
it should not be classed  as was done by linn  us  with the decidedly
venomous viperine serpent  the  viper communis   or  pelias berus   of
which figuier says     it is not improbable that it is the  echis            
of aristotle and the  vipera  of virgil  as it is the  manasso  of the
italians  the  adder  of the country people of england and scotland  and
the  vip  re  of france  it is found in all these countries and in europe
generally        

in an article contributed to a medical journal     i have said  in
reference to the   sculapian serpent  that it is the one    which should
always be shown in medical symbolism     this would hardly be questioned by
many  yet i am disposed to think that the restriction is too exclusive 
another species of coluber  the ur  us  or asp  has played a significant
r  le  as a symbol of life and healing  especially in egypt  as will be
seen later  our medical traditions  however  being mainly derived from
the greeks  it would therefore seem but right that we should confine
ourselves very exclusively to the symbolism in use by them 




chapter iv 

the epidaurian oracle 


in speaking of the god of medicine at rome  mention was made of
epidaurus  the original great seat of worship of   sculapius  in the
peloponnesian place of that name  in the district of argolis  on the
western shore of the saronic gulf  i will now pause a while  for here is
a spot of earth of special interest  dearer than salerno  or even cos  to
every lover of the annals  historical and legendary  of the healing art 

very different is epidaurus now from what it was in other days  there
has been a change  and for the worse  here was once the scene of teeming
life  the home of a people of culture and renown  it is not so at
present  as with many other parts of greece  time has dealt harshly with
epidaurus  but for the ruins and the imperishable records we have of
them  one could find very little there worthy of much attention 

it is chiefly in the work of pausanias  before mentioned  that the
great medical institution of epidaurus  the   sculapian temple  with its
auxiliaries  survives  this observing and inquisitive old greek traveler
has left an interesting account of it  he lived in the second century of
our era 

the ruins have been carefully studied and described by mr  leake     

under a commission from the arch  ological society of athens  mr 
p  kavvadias  in      and forward to the present time         has
been making exploratory excavations  for full accounts of which the
   proceedings of the society    must be consulted     

although the asclepion was not within the town of epidaurus  it was
generally spoken of as part and parcel of the latter  thus  strabo
says     epidaurus was a distinguished city  remarkable particularly on
account of the fame of   sculapius  who was supposed to cure every kind of
disease  and whose temple is crowded constantly with sick persons  and
its walls covered with votive tablets  which are hung thereon and contain
accounts of the cures in the same manner as is practiced at cos and at
tricca         in the time of the romans  the town was regarded as    little
more than the harbor        of the   sculapian oracle  still  at one time
it was of considerable importance  pausanias speaks favorably of it  in
it there were statues of   sculapius and his reputed wife  epione  and of
diana  venus  and others  there were public accommodations for persons
dying and lying in women  this was necessary  because births and deaths
were not allowed to occur within the sacred grove  the exclusion was 
according to pausanias     agreeable to a law which is established in the
island of delos        

epidaurus was open to intercourse with the ph  nicians and other peoples 
its citizens were enterprising  it is interesting to note that they
colonized the island of cos 

under the name of pidhavro the ancient town remains in existence  but it
is a mere hamlet of a few dozen families  most of which are engaged in
raising vegetables for the athenian market 

proceeding in a southwesterly direction from the site of epidaurus  one
comes  after a journey of about five roman miles  to the location of the
famous epidaurian oracle of   sculapius  it is a little vale  bordered
almost all around with shrubbery clad hills  notable among which are
mounts titthium  cynortium  and coryph  us  the first and second to the
north  and the third to the southeast  at a little distance down it 
flowing westerly and emptying into the river of lessa  is a rivulet
formed by two main branches  one of which springs from about mount
coryph  us and traverses the sacred              or grove 

to the sacred grove  the name of hierum  or  rather  sto hieron      a
synonym  is applied  it is less than a mile in circumference  within it
are found remains of most of the structures which it formerly contained 
in the centre stood the temple  or sanctuary  of   sculapius  in the
southeast  at the foot of mount coryph  us  the theatre      which
afforded accommodation for twelve thousand people  and which is one of
the finest ruins of ancient grecian buildings  and southwest of the
temple was the place devoted to athletic games  the stadium  to the
north of which were the cistrum and the tholus  or circular cell  about
thirty feet in circumference  which contained paintings and other works
of art  and probably served as a place of reunion of the officials of the
sanctuary  and for certain sacrifices and ceremonies  water pipes have
been unearthed  and there are remnants of the peribolus  or enclosure 
which  according to leake  however  was present only on two sides  the
steep hills answering the purpose on the others  the somewhat remarkable
state of preservation of these ruins is largely due to the seclusion of
the place 

of course  the most notable building within the sacred grounds was the
temple      this was the abode of the god  here was his oracle  his
statue was of great splendor and highly renowned  it was formed of ivory
and gold   chryselephantine   and was by thrasymedes  of parus    sculapius
was represented as a man somewhat advanced in life  but of attractive
presence  seated on a throne  his hair and beard were given long  perhaps
too long for an ideal physician      in his left hand he held a staff 
and the other he held over the head of a serpent  at his feet was the
figure of a dog  on the throne were wrought illustrations of the works
of the argive heroes  bellerophon was shown in the act of slaying the
chim  ra  and perseus cutting off the head of medusa 

besides the temple  the theatre  gymnasium  and other buildings mentioned
above  there were still others to meet the manifold needs of the numerous
visitors  as those who came to consult the oracle remained a night or
longer  there must have been an extensive dormitory  it is referred to
by pausanias      those  however  who approached the god  always  i
believe  passed the night in the sanctuary 

when at the height of its glory the hierum was surely a place full of
life  being the most famous sanatory retreat  multitudes flocked to it
from all parts of greece and beyond  many who came were  doubtless 
invalids  but likely far more could not be classed as such  in fact 
this   sculapian grove  although mainly a medical institution  a sort of
hospital  might reasonably be taken as a prototype of modern popular
health resorts 

the glory of the epidaurian oracle was not short lived  in the year    
b c   the time when the roman embassy paid the historic visit  it was
very great  and five centuries later   that is  in the time of pausanias   it
had not passed away  the worship of the serpentine divinity had not then
ceased 

with years the oracle accumulated riches  so that it became noted for
its treasures  when  in the year     b c   it was visited by l    milius
paulus  after his conquest of macedonia  it was rich in gifts presented
by those who had obtained relief there from their afflictions  a century
and a half later many of the valuable offerings had disappeared 

the visitors to the great oracle in search of health placed themselves
under the care of the asclepiades  or disciples of the god  a special
course of regimen  treatment  was followed  it is said that it was
directed by   sculapius  through dreams    not necessarily a truth  the plan
pursued was more or less scientific and free from superstition  mr  leake
rather ungraciously remarks that the advisors  being    equally dexterous
as priests and physicians  provided themselves with resources in either
capacity  which they could turn to the benefit of their patients   
infirmities and their own profit         the rules were decidedly strict 
records of patients were preserved  and the tablets on which they were
placed were hung up in the temple and elsewhere  some of those surviving
from the stel    mentioned by pausanias      have been unearthed recently
by mr  kavvadias  they are mostly statements of miraculous cures     

famous and immensely popular as the epidaurian oracle was  it cannot
be said to have had notable natural advantages in its favor  the site
was not one of the best  being low and hill bounded    conditions closely
related to unhealthy states of humidity and heat of the atmosphere  the
supply of water was not good  dependence having to be placed at times on
cisterns  the locations of many other  but less noted  asclepia  were
certainly far more sanatory  at cos there was pure  mild sea air  and 
of those in the mountains or by fountains  each had one or more special
natural attractions  indeed  there could seemingly be few much worse
sites than this close little epidaurian valley  without even a mineral
spring  or  in fact  a good spring of ordinary water to recommend it 
but  greater than any one  or all climatic or other influences in power
to attract the multitude  was the belief that at his birthplace and
primary seat and oracle the influence of the god of medicine could be
most effectively brought to bear to remove disease and restore health  as
in this case  a pleasing superstition may work wonders 




chapter v 

asclepia and the asclepiades 


many asclepia  or temples of health  were in time established throughout
greece and her colonies and elsewhere  a recent writer states that at
least three hundred and twenty are known    to have existed in antiquity 
so that every town of importance must have had its sanctuary         in
success and length of existence they  of course  varied greatly  the
one at epidaurus has been spoken of  and others of great celebrity were
those of tricca  cnidus  and cos  to say nothing of some only a little
less deserving of mention  such as those at rhodes  pergamus  carthage 
athens      and rome 

the asclepion at tricca  in thessaly  was probably started by the sons of
  sculapius  machaon and podalirius  at any rate  according to homer  they
were attendants there  this was enough to bring it into repute  but its
situation in the mountains was much in its favor as a popular sanatory
resort 

the coan and cnidian asclepia were favorably located  the former on the
island of the name  which pliny speaks of as    flourishing and powerful in
the highest degree and consecrated to   sculapius         and the latter not
far distant  on a site decidedly maritime  in asia minor  these temples
were both very distinguished  and a degree of rivalry prevailed between
them  in them there was undoubtedly much highly creditable medical
knowledge in exercise  the same was probably the case in most  or perhaps
all  others  especially in later times  but it is in respect to those
only that we have indubitable evidence of the fact  of the two schools 
the adherents of the cnidian paid special attention to the symptoms of
individual cases  and avoided  as much as possible  powerful cathartics 
bleeding  and other active means of cure 

whatever may have been the success of the various asclepia  institutions
which were finally blotted out in the early part of the fourth century by
constantine  the first christian emperor      that of cos was destined
to make the greatest impress on the medicine of the future  it was the
good fortune of this institution to have in connection with it  at the
acme of its career  a great author as well as physician  hippocrates  a
native of the island  rendered the fame of the coan school imperishable 
and gave to his fellow men throughout the world  in all time to come  a
legacy of incalculable value  through this early and great medical writer
his  alma mater  has been made  in a manner  that of the medical man of
all ages  from cos sprang forth at the touch of a humble man  afterward
called appreciatively    the divine old man     a mass of medical knowledge 
wonderfully pure and good  which constitutes the main body of the real
medical science of our own day 

an asclepion     consisted essentially of a building with a more or
less hygienical site  usually in the country and near a fountain     
sometimes a mineral one  in which the arts of healing were practiced
by priests or disciples of   sculapius  called asclepiades  in all  the
influence of the god was generally believed to be an essential factor 
and hence in each an image of him was to be found  but the fully equipped
institution had many appliances  as has been shown in the account given
of the one at epidaurus  arrangements for exercises  baths  and other
means which were brought to bear to restore people to health were duly
provided and were in many instances elaborate 

the asclepiades claimed that they were descended directly from the god of
whom they were the disciples  they were not  at any time  mere priests 
that is  ministers of religion  indeed  it has been asserted that    there
is no sign in the homeric poems of the subordination of medicine to
religion        

the asclepiades constituted a special class  and they were oath bound
to preserve the mysteries of the art from the uninitiated  the oath is
preserved in the hippocratic collection      and is usually called by his
name  it begins thus     i swear by apollo  the physician  and   sculapius 
and health  and all heal      and all the gods and goddesses that 
according to my ability and judgment  i will keep this oath and this
stipulation     in it occurs this passage     i will follow that system of
regimen     which  according to my ability and judgment  i consider for
the benefit of my patients  and abstain from whatever is deleterious and
mischievous     here is another     with purity and with holiness i will pass
my life and practice my art     cutting for the stone is left to those who
make a special business of it  what is learned about patients  in the
exercise of the art  which should be kept secret is not to be divulged 
mr  adams well says that it is most honorable to the profession that
so ancient a document pertaining to it as this     instead of displaying
narrow minded and exclusive selfishness  inculcates a generous line of
conduct  and enjoins an observance of the rules of propriety and of the
laws of domestic morality        

it has been said  in a learned article     on ancient medicine  that    the
asclepiad   of greece were the true originators    of scientific medicine 
this claim might be questioned  but it is  doubtless  in the main just 
certainly all physicians were not connected with asclepia  and in later
times the asclepiades proper were avoided by the more intelligent and
rational 

unfortunately  the records of the practice of the asclepiades have been
almost entirely lost  this is to be regretted  and more especially
because what is preserved is of a decidedly high order of merit     
however  it is probable that at least the  cr  me  of the whole has been
handed down to us by hippocrates 

it seems certain that in the first    prorrhetics    and the    pr  notiones
coacae     which are transmitted to us in the hippocratic collection  we
have fragments and excerpts from the histories of diseases and cures
which were formerly found on the votive tablets of the coan temple  from
these records hippocrates drew largely in composing his highly valuable
   book of prognostics     in reference to the matter adams says     it is
as clear as the light of day that hippocrates composed this work from
them        

it is more than probable that  except for a short time at first  the
system of treatment pursued by the asclepiades varied within wide limits 
and it is equally certain that the superstitious element lessened as time
passed  between the principles of practice of   sculapius and those of
hippocrates     there is a very wide difference  those of the former will
be given later  but of those of the latter i may say here that they were
essentially scientific      to hippocrates every disease had a natural
cause  and was to be cured by natural means  he was wont    to consult
nature herself about nature     as bacon has somewhere wisely advised 
he did not attribute any morbid condition to any spiritual power  good
or bad  and hence in his practice did not resort to conjuration or any
related means of cure  even of epilepsy  the so called    sacred disease    
he said     it is thus with regard to the disease called sacred  it appears
to me to be nowise more divine nor more sacred than other diseases  but
has a natural cause from which it originates like other affections     and
again     men regard its nature and cause as divine  from ignorance and
wonder         as regards holding disease to be divinely inflicted  he very
properly remarks     i do not count it a worthy opinion to hold that the
body of man is polluted by god        

not only in the principles of medicine  but in its practice  hippocrates
was wonderfully sound  even when judged from the stand point of the art
in our day  in truth  for extent and profundity of medical knowledge and
philosophy  between him and what modern would one think of instituting
a comparison  sydenham has been likened to him  but  although i am an
admirer of the english physician  i do not hesitate to say that he was
neither in breadth nor depth any such man as the coan  as a writer on the
prevention and cure of disease  hippocrates remains  facile princeps  

let it not be hastily supposed that my admiration for hippocrates is
unreasonably great  his works are truly a surprise to even the well read
modern  very many of the so called discoveries of recent times may be
learned by turning to them  i speak advisedly  i will cite instances    

thus  of the treatment of open sores  he says     in these cases no part
is to be exposed to the air     dressings of    wine and oil    and    pitched
cerate        are directed to be used 

again  in treating fractures  in connection with certain splints  he
advises that    a soft  consistent  and clean cerate should be rubbed
into the folds of the bandage         and he says     if you see that the
bones are properly adjusted by the first dressing  and that there is no
troublesome pruritus in the part  nor any reason to suspect ulceration 
you may allow the arm to remain bandaged in the splints until after the
lapse of more than twenty days        

still again  in regard to the reduction of a dislocation at the
hip joint  he says     in some the thigh is reduced with no preparation 
with slight extension  directed by the hands  and with slight movement 
and in some the reduction is effected by bending the limb at the joint
and making rotation        

in the three preceding paragraphs we have the practical side of the germ
theory of disease  the permanent dressing of fractures  and the reduction
of dislocations by manipulation 

i might go on and recount numerous other matters alleged to be new  and
of which we hear much  but it is not necessary  i may add  however  a few
items of interest    

   bleed     says the old greek     in the acute affections  if the disease
appears strong  and if the patients be in the vigor of life  and if they
have strength     has any modern spoken more wisely on the subject     

here is a statement worthy of the attention of unbalanced theorists
of our day  in fevers and pneumonia  heat    is not the sole cause of
mischief        

he gives directions for the use of effusions with    water of various
temperatures    in    cases of pneumonia     of    ardent fevers     and of
other diseases  this treatment  he thinks     suits better with cases of
pneumonia than in ardent fevers        

in that inimitable book  his    aphorisms     it is said     in general 
diseases are cured by their contraries     there is no exclusive allopathy
or hom  opathy  or dogma of any kind  in that statement  it is the
sentiment of a scientific physician 

medicine was evidently far advanced in the days of hippocrates      and
he was certainly a learned and sensible practitioner of it  even the
   prince of physicians     as galen  i think  somewhere characterizes him 
as well as one who did much to make it what he pronounced it himself to
be  namely     of all arts the most noble        




chapter vi 

the grecian god of medicine 


during most of the earlier part of their history it is safe to say the
greeks regarded apollo as their main god of medicine  being possessed
of the eminent qualities of a sun god  replacing helios as such  and
both mighty and popular  this was to be expected  nothing could be more
natural than to accord to a deification of the orb of day a direct
concern with matters pertaining to life and death      who so blind and
stupid as not to see and know that all vital activity is intimately
connected with the presence and movements  apparent  of this great light 
and heat producing heavenly body 

in an old chaldean hymn the power of the sun over health and disease is
recognized  he is petitioned to relieve a patient  the petitioner  after
saying that    the great lord  hea  had sent him     continues    

       thou at thy coming  cure the race of man 
    cause a ray of health to shine upon him 
    cure his disease        

however  the reader of homer is well aware that medical affairs were
regarded by the greeks as subject to the will of ph  bus  the epidemic
which affected the grecian forces  spoken of in the beginning of his
great work  was held to be caused by the god  being moved to anger by the
words of his daughter robbed priest   

       latona   s son a dire contagion spread
    and heap   d the camp with mountains of the dead        

chryses  having received the maiden     back from her kingly
abductor      then addressed apollo again  saying  among other things    

       if fir   d to vengeance at thy priest   s request 
    thy direful darts inflict the raging pest 
    once more attend  avert the wasteful woe
    and smile propitious and unbend thy bow        

the prayer was heard and answered as desired 

surgical as well as purely medical aid was sought and received from
apollo  thus  when the lycian chief  sarpedon  was killed  glaucus 
himself sorely wounded and unable to protect his friend   s remains 
petitioned the    god of health     the    god of every healing art     and

       apollo heard  and suppliant as he stood 
    his heavenly hand restrain   d the flux of blood 
    he drew the dolours from the wounded part 
    and breath   d a spirit in his rising heart        

one of the names often applied to apollo      and subsequently to his
son      was distinctly medical  viz   p  on  or paieon      homer always
uses it in referring to the physician of the olympian gods  as where he
speaks of the pharian race as    from p  on sprung            p  onian herbs       
is the phrase used by virgil in his account of the restoration to life
of hippolytus  and this leads me to say that apollo was believed to have
a special knowledge of medicinal plants  by ovid he is represented as
saying    

       what herbs and simples grow
    in fields  in forests  all their power i know        

it may be further said that apollo always continued to have healing
powers accorded him  no more proof of this is wanting than the first
clause of the hippocratic oath      i swear by apollo  the physician    

it would seem to have been about the time of the trojan war that the
special god of medicine began to be viewed as such by the greeks  strong
reason for so believing is found in the fact that homer refers to
  sculapius as simply    a blameless doctor            a mortal  the adjective
used never being applied to a god  a well informed writer remarks that
   the kernel out of which the whole myth has grown is  perhaps  the
account we read in homer          this opinion is open to question  even
the title of archegetes  or primeval divinity  was sometimes given to
  sculapius  and  indeed  under that title he was worshipped by the
phocians in a temple situated eighty stadia      from tithorea  this name
was also given  it must be said  to apollo  from whom probably it was
received by the son  i may add here the suggestion of the abb   banier 
that likely a distinguished physician  called   sculapius       of the age
of hercules and jason  being highly honored  was in time confounded with
the old ph  nician and egyptian god  esmun     so that in process of time
the worship of the latter came to be quite forgotten  and the new god
substituted altogether in his room         

galen expresses doubt whether the divinity of   sculapius was the result
of a gradual development from a human basis  but pausanias says     that
  sculapius was from the first considered as a god  and that his fame
was not owing to length of time  i find confirmed by various arguments 
and even by the authority of homer  in the following verses  in which
agamemnon thus speaks of machaon    

       talthibius  hither swift  machaon bring 
    who from the blameless   sculapius sprung         

which is just as much as if he had said     call a man who is a son of a
god            

in the indulgence of their myth forming fancies it was very reasonable 
very wise  on the part of the greeks to make   sculapius the offspring
of apollo  if the god of medicine be viewed as a personification of the
healing powers of nature  what more rational  as has been observed 
than to take him to be    the son  the effects of helios  apollo  or the
sun         

the mythological history of the grecian god of medicine is strange and
interesting  one must know it  or he will remain in the dark about many
things bearing on the symbolism and other features of the physician   s art 

  sculapius was the result  so the story runs  of a criminal  liaison 
between apollo and a young virgin  named coronis  a native of
thessaly   something which the myth makers apparently did not regard as
discreditable  the morals of many of the gods were exceedingly bad     our
manners have been corrupted by communication with the saints         
is a candid remark of thoreau  it would appear that the ancients were
corrupted by communication with the gods 

it is recorded of coronis that she was  like too many of the sex  fickle 
and did not prove faithful to her divine paramour  she stealthily
cultivated a criminal intimacy with an arcadian youth  named ischys 
the fact of her infidelity becoming known to apollo  either through a
message of a raven       or his own divine powers  he  naturally enough 
was greatly displeased  and the wrath of the divinity was followed by a
series of remarkable events 

at this point it may be well to state that the parentage of   sculapius
was a question which early excited attention  a belief existed that    he
was the offspring of arsino      and    a citizen of the messenians     as
pausanias informs us  apollophanes  an arcadian       being interested in
the matter  went to delos  and  putting the question of its truth to the
pythian deity  received this reply    

       o   sculapius  source of mighty joy
    to mortal natures  whom coronis fair 
    daughter of phlegyas  once with me conjoin   d 
    in epidauria   s barren region bore         

according to this dictum  he was  indeed  born in epidaurus  pausanias 
by way of proof of the truth of it  says     i find that the most
illustrious rites of   sculapius were derived from epidaurus          from
that point the worship seems to have spread  it is said  however  by
strabo       that his birthplace was tricca  in thessaly      

however  to return to our story  the time of the delivery of coronis was
not far off  when the news of her perfidy reached apollo  notwithstanding
this  he  being seemingly under the influence of the    green eyed
monster    to an ungodly degree  cruelly resolved on having revenge at
once  artemis       the goddess of chastity  was directed to slay the
unfaithful maid with a thunderbolt  and the order was duly executed  on
coins of pergamus the unfortunate thessalian appears entirely veiled 

after the fatal thunderbolt had descended on the  enceinte  coronis  and
her body was being consumed in the merciless pyre  apollo   s paternal
feelings became stirred  and saying  as pindar tells us 

       i may not bear to slay my child
    with his sad mother  sin defiled         

proceeded forthwith to save his unborn offspring 

to what manner of operation did he resort  i leave it to some all knowing
specialist to find out  but  at any rate  by some method or other  the
child was rescued       another version of the affair  preserved by
pausanias  robs the god of any possible skill as a gyn  cologist   surgical 
i mean  according to it  when coronis was undergoing cremation  after
being slain by artemis     the boy is said to have been snatched by
hermes from the flames          and of this i may observe that it was
not inappropriate to have hermes  the grecian metamorphosis of the
thrice great god of wisdom and knowledge of the egyptians  present at the
unnatural  accouchement   and in such close relation to   sculapius at the
very beginning of his wonderful career 

it was  then  the unhappy fate of   sculapius to be an orphan from his
birth  if birth he had  to speak correctly  and it is possible that his
advent was decidedly premature   in a medical sense  apollo was puzzled
to know what to do with his tender son  nor did he do for him all that
could be expected  for baby   sculapius was heartlessly exposed on
mount titthium  here the little unfortunate fell into the keeping of
a friendly goat and dog  the goat gave the precious  enfant trouv   
nourishment       as amalthea had done zeus  and the dog kept guard over
him       splendid services  indeed  on the part of two humble animals 
in the interest of medicine and humanity 

on epidaurian coins  the infantile god of medicine is appropriately
represented under a she goat on mount titthium  with aresthanas
approaching  this person was the shepherd of whom pausanias says that 
coming to the rescue     he beheld a splendor beaming from the infant  and 
thinking that it was something divine  as indeed it was  departed from
the place  but a report     he continues     was immediately spread through
every land and sea that such as were afflicted with any kind of disease
were healed by the boy  and that even the dead were raised to life         
the reader need hardly be informed that accounts parallel to this are
common enough in ancient records 

how it happened that the child of coronis  a thessalian  first saw the
light in epidauria  a country which became particularly sacred to him  is
a question which should be answered  it appears that coronis came there
with her warlike father  phlegyas  who gave  as a reason for his visit 
a desire to see the country  but     in reality     pausanias says     that he
might inspect the multitude of the inhabitants  and learn whether there
was a great quantity of fighting men         

pindar states that apollo  on rescuing his child  bore him at once to
chiron   

       to learn of human woes the healing lore         

which does away with the fabled discreditable exposure of him  but
whether this be so or not  in progress of time  he did put him under the
care and instruction of    the beneficent leech          cheiron  to use the
archaic expression of the historian  grote        the thessalian centaur 
or fabulous monster  whose figure from the waist down was like the body
of a horse       under the direction of this strangely formed creature 
  sculapius proceeded to study the medical virtues of plants  for chiron
was a great herbalist  being called by homer  in the words of pope     the
sire of pharmacy          in time the pupil exceeded the teacher in his
knowledge of drugs 

chiron was regarded  pindar tells us       as the son of saturn and
the sea nymph philyra  and hence was a brother of zeus  saturn changed
himself into a horse to conceal his amour with the nymph from his wife 
rhea  this would account for the form of the centaur 

chiron lived in a cave on mount pelion  in thessaly  it will be
remembered that it was from there that he got the ashen spear      for
peleus  which the son brought into use  a ponderous spear  which   

                       stern achilles only wields 
    the death of heroes and the dread of fields         

according to homer       hercules received instruction in medicine from
chiron  and it is stated  by pindar       that jason was another pupil
of his  with these   sculapius went  as physician  on the celebrated
argonautic expedition 

at the end of his career  the centaur became  it is said  the sign of the
zodiac  sagittarius      

in treating the sick    sculapius soon proved himself a master  his
patients did not die  and it appears that he recalled a few from    the
shades below     but  sad to relate  the great success he had in curing the
sick  and especially his recalling some from the other world  led to his
destruction  pluto  the god of the nether regions  not wishing a sparse
population       became displeased with him and complained to zeus  who 
probably believing that he was becoming too powerful  so much so as to
make man undying       cut short his career with a thunderbolt    a tragedy
which caused his father  apollo  to wander away to the land of the
hyperboreans and to shed tears of gold  at the request of apollo he was
placed among the stars       the eighth day of the eleusinian mysteries
was devoted to sacrifices to him  and was called epidauria 

from what virgil says  it would seem that it was not because of the
direct exercise of his power to restore life that   sculapius was
destroyed  but because of the degree of perfection to which he had
brought the medical art  the event     the fable          as pliny designates
it  is connected with the restoration of hippolytus or virbius  and is
thus referred to by the roman poet    

       but chaste diana who his death deplor   d
    with   sculapian herbs his life restor   d 
    then jove  who saw from high with just disdain
    the dead inspired with vital breath again 
    struck to the centre with his flaming dart
    the unhappy founder of the god like art         

the plan of treatment pursued by   sculapius was variable  after speaking
of the sick     a host forlorn    that flocked to him  pindar says    

       some spells brought back to life 
    these drank the potion plan   d  for these he bound
    with drugs the aching wound 
    some leaped to strength beneath the helpful knife         

the lines just given certainly serve to disprove the statement of pliny 
that in homeric times    the healing art confined itself solely to the
treatment of wounds          it is doubtless true  however  that nothing is
said in homer   s works about particular diseases 

it has been held that   sculapius  like more   s utopians  did not think
it wise to bring to bear the art of healing in the case of any one who
might not be restored to health and to usefulness to himself and others 
says plato     he thought medical treatment ill bestowed upon one who could
not live in his regular round of duties  and so was of no use either to
himself or to the state          the great philosopher accordingly regarded
him as    a profound politician     for  in his ideal state  this celebrated
theorizer would have physicians    bestow their services on those only of
the citizens whose bodily and mental constitutions are sound and good 
leaving those that are otherwise  as to the state of their body  to
die  and actually putting to death those who are naturally corrupt and
incurable in soul          some excellent reasons might be advanced in
favor of such a harsh policy  but  while human love of life and human
sympathy remain as now  it will never be brought into play       as
an ideal physician    sculapius could hardly have been an advocate of
it      

i may say a word about the charge of pindar  that the efforts of
  sculapius to recall the dead to life were inspired by temptation with
gold  the poet says    

       alas  that filthy gain can blind the wise 
    the glittering gold betrayed the noble leech 
    from the dark prison house to bid arrive
    a captive thrall of death 
    but jove with wrathful hand refused to each
    the hallowed breath 
    down came the bolt of fire         

making such an ugly charge is probably unjust to the great healer  the
historian  grote  thinks so  and expresses the opinion that pindar was
disposed    to extenuate the cruelty of zeus by imputing guilty and sordid
views to   sculapius          long ago the accusation was met by plato 
says he     while they      assert that   sculapius was the son of apollo 
they declare that he was induced by a bribe of gold to raise to life a
rich man who was dead  which was the cause of his being smitten with
a thunderbolt  but we  with our principles  cannot believe both these
statements of theirs  we shall maintain that  if he was the son of a
god  he was not covetous  if he was covetous  he was not the son of
apollo          he was the son of apollo 

to conclude this imperfect sketch of the life of   sculapius  i may add
that he was married  as every wise as well as respectable physician
should be       and  as was desirable in an exemplar  the father of at
least six children    two sons and four daughters  the two sons  machaon
and podalirius  taught by their    parent god     as homer informs us 
became    famed surgeons        divine professors of the healing art         
and were also distinguished warriors under agamemnon  of the daughters 
hygeia  panacea  jaso  and   gle  the first became the goddess of health 
of whom more anon 




chapter vii 

the image of   sculapius 


a simple image of a god may be regarded as a symbol  when the image
has connected with it one or more figures to indicate the qualities
or functions of the divinity  we have then  strictly speaking  an
allegorical representation    sculapius was sometimes shown in the one way
and sometimes in the other  thus  he was occasionally to be seen at rome 
and elsewhere  in the form of a serpent  and  at the epidaurian grove 
for example  as a man having in connection with him a serpent  a dog  and
other things 

as is implied in what i have just said  there was no set  invariable mode
of portrayal of   sculapius  this fact should be clearly understood  but
let it not be supposed that it is by any means singular  it will occur
to the well informed reader that the same holds true in regard to zeus 
apollo  venus  and  indeed  all other divinities  says m  ller     the
so called ideals of the grecian gods are not types  they do not preclude
the freedom of the artist  they rather contain the strongest impulse to
new  genial creations          it is  perhaps  self evident that a statue
of a god must necessarily be quite ideal  and  of course  an ideal is
without absolute permanency  still  it remains true that in the case of
  sculapius  as well as that of every other deity  there was a more or
less definite conventional way of representing him  this  however  was
largely dependent on the presence of attributes  thus  it would be not
only inconsistent with custom  but almost futile  to attempt to delineate
him without the presence of a serpent 

the most magnificent representation of   sculapius was the one at
epidaurus  a description of it has already been given  this fine work of
art disappeared at an early day  the vandals could not be expected to
spare it  the gold in its composition was fatal to its permanency  it was
borne on coins of epidaurus  according to strabo       a copy of it was
taken to the galatian town  pessinus  not rome  as is often said  several
other places were similarly favored 

there was a very celebrated statue of   sculapius at the renowned
asclepion of pergamus  the production of the artist pyromachus  as well
as one similar to that of epidaurus  it became the prevailing type
in art  in it the god was represented as a mature man of benevolent
expression  with his rather long hair bound with a fillet  and in
his right hand he held a staff enwreathed with a serpent  he wore a
himation      drawn tight over the left arm and breast  the whole right
side from the waist up was uncovered  his attitude was that of a person
ready to render assistance     we can recognize     says m  ller     the figure
with tolerable certainty as the most usual representation of the god on
numerous coins of pergamus         

the well known statue of   sculapius at berlin resembles that at pergamus 
and the same is true of one at florence  and others  that of berlin has
the serpent wreathed staff  or support  placed on the left side  this
appears to have been frequently done  an instance of it i have observed
in a gem bearing   sculapius and hygeia  taken from a tomb at thron    a
piece of work of the roman period  it is shown in general di cesnola   s
interesting work      

while   sculapius was made to appear aged in some instances  as in the
epidaurian representation  he was sometimes presented in youthful form 
and beardless  like his father  apollo  and this reminds me of the story
told of dyonysius  king of sicily  that  on conquering the morea  he
ordered the beard to be taken off the epidaurian statue of the god  for
the reason that it was unbecoming and unjust for the son to have a beard
when the father had none  possibly if it had not been a golden one it
would not have been molested 

i may venture to say that both aged and youthful representations of
  sculapius are open to criticism  an ideal physician should be  as in
the statue at pergamus  a man in his prime  or  in other words  mature 
but neither young nor old  the immature man is apt to be defective in
judgment  and the superannuated one is nearly always of excessively
routine practice and ignorant of recent advances in his profession 

by way of conclusion  i will say a few words about the famous
colossal head of   sculapius  originally colored and decorated with
a bronze wreath  now in the british museum  where it has been since
      it represents  with marked freedom and breadth of execution  a
finely developed man of middle age  with a cast of countenance similar to
that of the phidian zeus  the beard is of moderate length and is waved
like the somewhat long hair  this is really one of the noblest remnants
of grecian art  nichols  in whose work      an engraving of it is given
as a frontispiece  just as it is in this one  regards it    as scarcely
less remarkable    than the celebrated    venus of milo    in the louvre  both
of which were found  the former in       on the island of melos  it is
considered to be the work of an artist of the macedonian period  about
b c         a time when the greek sculptor had attained perfect mastery of
his art 




chapter viii 

the   sculapian staff and serpent 


the staff      and serpent of   sculapius being of special emblematic
significance  i deem it proper to speak of it at some length  the
confusion of ideas which appears to prevail extensively in regard to it
implies that a definite  explicit account of it is much needed 

although  as will be remembered  ovid makes   sculapius refer to his
serpent enwreathed staff when addressing the commission which came from
rome to epidaurus  in the famous representation of him given there  none
was present  the poet may possibly have been misled by what had become
familiar to him at home  for one was to be seen in connection with the
statue of the god at rome  it is probable  however  that it was a common
occurrence for a living serpent  one of the species kept and viewed as
sacred in the hierum  to climb the staff in the hand of the epidaurian
statue 

it is very likely that the staff bearing a serpent became a
characteristic emblem of the god of medicine through the great work of
the sculptor  pyromachus  at the asclepion of pergamus  which i have
already described  the appropriateness of it was widely recognized  but
it was not always adopted  as is attested by the remains of ancient art 

apart from the serpent  the import of which will be fully treated of in
the succeeding chapter  the staff as an attribute of   sculapius merits
study  like many other apparently simple things in art  it may stand for
a great deal more than one would suppose on first view 

the object encircled by a serpent held in the hand of the   sculapian
statue by pyromachus  at pergamus  is evidently a walking stick  the
epidaurian statue has a similar object in one of the hands  and the same
is the case in many others  hence  as the representations of the gods
of the ancients had rarely or never anything but significant attributes
attached to them  it is pertinent to ask an explanation of its presence 
was there an historical basis for it  in other words  was   sculapius
notoriously in the habit of carrying a staff  if so  it is possible that
this was why pyromachus  thrasymedes  and other artists connected one
with figures of him  but there is no special reason for believing that
such was the case      

 illustration  fig       club or staff of   sculapius    from maffei    

then  did the artists place a staff in the hand of   sculapius of their
own accord to indicate the perambulatory character of the physician   s
calling  such an attribute was doubtless deemed appropriate by them 
but  before one could believe that they gave it on the score of apparent
appropriateness  it would have to be shown that it was in the power of
artists to design gods at pleasure    something which could not be done 
they evolved it  i may venture to say  from something allied in form 

there is little or no ground for believing that the staff of   sculapius
was a wonder working object  i am not aware that such a thing was
placed intentionally in his hand by any artist  hence  the references
often made to the mystic wand of the god spring from misapprehension  a
walking staff being something very different 

one can obtain  i believe  from an examination of the berlin statue and
others    in which   sculapius is represented leaning on  or standing by  a
post of variable thickness and more or less regular in shape    a clue to
an explanation of the origin of the staff  between the two objects the
difference is not great  certainly not radical  and as attributes they
might be expressive of the same thing  the club shown in the picture
 fig      from maffei  might be viewed as intermediate 

of course  i do not say that the prototype of the staff was the post
present in some representations of   sculapius  although the idea would
not be entirely unreasonable  there is more ground for the opinion that
both were  so to speak  the offspring of something else 

any one familiar with the antique representations of   sculapius  and who
has also seen different ones of apollo  might well be inclined to believe
that both gods have essentially the same thing by their side  namely  a
post with a clinging serpent  and when it is recalled that   sculapius
was the son of apollo  the opinion might be advanced with some degree of
reasonableness  that the emblem of the former was  in reality  that of
the latter  somewhat modified 

tracing thus the origin of the staff of   sculapius to the related symbol
possessed by his father  apollo  it would not be satisfactory to rest
here  one naturally wants to know something about the latter  a few
words  however  on the subject must suffice 

although it was not an uncommon thing for artists to give posts by
the side of statues  the one bearing the serpent in  say  the apollo
belvedere  was  it is thought  meant to represent the omphalos  to which
the grecians attached much significance 

the omphalos       in the form of a conical stone  was kept  and was
present within historical times  as strabo explicitly states  at delphi 
a place which  he says     was supposed to be the centre of the habitable
earth  and was called the navel of the earth          plato refers to
apollo as    the god whose seat is the middle point of the earth  its very
navel          according to a legend       delphi was esteemed the centre
of the earth  because two eagles sent out by zeus  one from the east and
the other from the west  met at that point  says strabo     in the temple
is seen a sort of navel  wrapped in bands and surmounted by figures
representing the birds of the fable         

the etymology of the word  omphalos  casts light on its meaning  olympos 
the mount of the gods  is a corruption of it   omphi el       is the
oracle of the sun god   al omphi  was used to designate hills  or
mountains  holwell says that the word came from egypt  and was originally
 ompha el   and related to the oracle of ham  or the sun       the idea
of a sacred mount or elevation is thus the original meaning of the word 
and here i may say that in hindu mythology considerable is said of a
mountain encircled by a great serpent      

let it not be supposed that the reasons in favor of the idea that the
omphalos became the staff of   sculapius are entirely insubstantial 
remains of ancient art furnish excellent proof of it  m  ller says     in
a pompeian picture    sculapius has beside him the omphalos  which is
entwisted with the well known net  composed of                   we see from this
that this symbol of apollo was also transferred to his son  on the coins
of the gens rubria  likewise  it is not an egg  as is usually asserted 
but  the omphalos placed on a circular altar that is encircled by the
  sculapian serpent          

to one versed in the history of ph  nicia and other oriental countries 
the omphalos is very certain to be viewed in another light than as a
symbol of a    high place     or mount      of worship  in the great tyrian
temple of baal melkarth  which herodotus went to see and admired much 
and of which that of solomon  or  rather  of jehovah on mount moriah
was almost a copy  even to the two pillars in front    symbols of the
sun god    were certain similar stones  carefully preserved and duly
reverenced  these  it is well known  were of procreative import  they
were phallic in character       was the omphalos of similar significance 
there is little reason to doubt that it was often regarded in that light 
   in the earliest times     says m  ller     a conical pillar  placed in the
street and called apollo agyicus  sufficed to keep in remembrance the
protecting and health bringing power of the god         

the staff  then  in the hand of   sculapius may have had its prototype
in the phallus    truly both an expressive and sublime symbol  when
contemplated by pure  enlightened minds 

but  notwithstanding what i have said  one might present some arguments
in favor of the view that the staff of   sculapius had its true prototype
in a magic wand or symbol of office  as will be pointed out later  the
accadio sumerian  silik mulu khi  the beneficent son of hea  subsequently
marodach or marduk of the babylonians and assyrians  a healing divinity 
from whom the conception of   sculapius may have partly sprung  carried a
reed when attending to his duties 

i may say  too  that some hold the staff in the hand of the egyptian
thoth to have been the original of the one accorded   sculapius  thus 
in an excellent and finely illustrated essay  w  r  cooper says     when
once the ur  us had been associated with the idea of divinity  the
theban priests  rightly desiring to ascribe the gift of life and the
power of healing to the deity alone  significantly enough twined the
serpent around the trident of jupiter ammon and the staff of thoth or
hermes trismegistus  the author of medicine  to imply the source from
which that subordinate demigod   s virtues were derived  from this  in
the later periods of her history  egypt remitted to greece  along with
the so called forty six hermetic treatises  the traditional  caduceus 
or serpent sceptre of cyllenius      and   sculapius  and  by subsequent
transformation of the same deities into a feminine form  the snake and
bowl of hygeia  the goddess of health          the    serpent sceptre    which
egypt    remitted    to cyllenius and to   sculapius must have changed greatly
in the passage  for it is anything but alike as seen in the hands of the
two  and in neither case is it very similar to the asserted original  as
well or better to take the staff and serpent to be the serpent bearing
tree    the tree of life in miniature 

however  the fact remains  as already stated  that   sculapius had no
wand  that is  a rod of magic power  the very different personage 
hermes  as also iris  the female messenger of the goddesses  had a
wand or  rather   caduceus   which  strange to say  is taken by many
to be a symbol of medicine  that is  the caduceus of hermes  which is
not of medical import at all  is accorded to   sculapius  who really
had none  i repeat  there is no such thing as an   sculapian wand  if
wand be taken to mean a rod possessed of wonder working power  but  of
course  the serpent bearing staff of   sculapius is an expressive medical
emblem       i give an example after one in a plate in de wilde   s rare
old book       one might take the serpent to be a symbol of the god and
the staff as symbolic of the moving of the physician from house to house
in the exercise of his profession  regarding the knots as expressive
of difficulties in the art and practice of medicine is very fanciful 
but not infrequently done  it is proper to observe  however  that the
physician   s staff in modern times is smooth  as will be pointed out later 

i deem it not amiss to give a cut of the caduceus of hermes  in the
hope of better removing misapprehension in regard to it  i give it as
shown on the seal of the united states marine hospital service  it is
an appropriate trade symbol  hermes being the god of commerce      as
well as the messenger of the gods  but it is more especially a symbol of
peace  the god being the great peace maker   see fig     

 illustration  fig       staff and serpent of   sculapius  

traditional history relates that  in his rambles one day  hermes saw
two snakes fighting  and  laying his wand   which was originally an
olive branch received from apollo   between them  was delighted to discover
that it had the power of putting an end to the encounter  and of turning
the two into friends  hence the presence of the two serpents on the wand 
the  virga  of the romans  the tradition was likely in the nature of an
after thought  if the two serpents be taken to represent two contending
persons  or nations  the mission of the ambassador with his wand or mace 
the symbol of authority  is well indicated 

 illustration  fig       the caduceus of hermes  

the two serpents on the caduceus have been taken to be male and female 
and in an amatory mood       thus  says aubrey     the caduceus of mercurie
is adorned with two serpents in the posture of generation          pliny
expressed an opinion similar to that of aubrey       this view was
adopted by the london medical publishers  the churchills  as will be seen
on looking at the title page of their books issued until recently  for
instance  on the title page of pettigrew   s    superstitions connected with
medicine and surgery     issued in       between two concentric circles
surrounding the caduceus  are the words   irrupta tenet copula   with
 literis medicina  on the serpents  later  the first phrase was dropped
and the other put in its place  for some years caduceus and all have very
properly been left out 

hermes was accorded some functions by the greeks which may well cause the
physician to feel that it is not very complimentary to associate either
him or the caduceus with his art  even if he be one who regards it
chiefly as a trade  thus  hermes  being an adept thief  was classed as
the god of rogues  and this brings to mind the remark of some one  that 
if medicine be a trade  it is the trade of all others the most exactly
cut out for a rogue  again  it was the function of hermes  very like that
of the archangel michael     to draw the souls from hollow graves     and
   drive them down the stygian waves     with his caduceus  as we are told by
virgil       it is hardly a part of the physician   s function  i submit 
to drive souls    down the stygian waves     certainly  no one professes to
do it 




chapter ix 

  sculapius and the serpent 


the serpent is undoubtedly the most significant of all medical symbols 
even   sculapius assumed such a form  and was sometimes so represented by
sculptors  it was to him the most sacred of all animals  down through the
ages this remarkable fact has been kept in view  and to day it is almost
as patent as ever 

now  what is the explanation of the serpent as a symbol in medicine  how
many medical men can say  several explanations have currency  but i may
candidly state that none of these are quite satisfactory  and i could not
refer to an acceptable one in all the volumes in which such information
might be expected to be found  with which i am familiar  here  then  is
a highly interesting and obvious fact to physicians  which few or none
completely understand  can i cast any light on it  some  certainly  but
just how much i must leave to the intelligent reader to judge  after
perusing this brief but comprehensive chapter 

the serpent in medicine is meant to symbolize prudence  something very
requisite in the physician  this opinion is one often expressed  it is
not necessarily baseless  to be    as wise as a serpent     and to have    the
subtlety of the serpent     are every day phrases  the reptile has been
accorded such qualities from a very early date  de gubernatis remarks
that in india it is still    revered as a symbol of every species of
learning         

it is often said that the serpent in medicine is meant to symbolize
the power of the art to produce renovation or rejuvenescence  this is
not an absurd notion  the basis of it is believed to be the periodical
renewal of the skin of the animal  this has long attracted attention 
in a precious extant fragment of the very ancient ph  nician book of
sanchoniathon it is said of the serpent     it is very long lived  and
has the quality not only of putting off its age and assuming a second
youth  but it receives a greater increase  and when it has fulfilled the
appointed measure of its existence it consumes itself          referring
to its reputed longevity  one intelligent writer says     this quality was
no doubt the cause why this animal entwined round a staff was the symbol
of health and the distinctive attribute of the classical   sculapius and
hygeia          at any rate  to restore people to health and renew their
age would be worthy employment for any one 

another prevalent idea is  that the serpent in medicine is meant to
symbolize convalescence  the remarkable change from a state of lethargy
to one of active life  which the reptile undergoes every spring 
affords some ground for it  it is taken advantage of in the device of
the rinovati academy  as will be seen by turning to mrs  pelliser   s
interesting book       three serpents are represented on a bank
gathering vigor in the sunshine  in the strengthening rays of apollo 
the educational interpretation is evidently quite as reasonable as the
medical 

of the three foregoing explanations of the symbolic import of the serpent
in medicine  it must be said that there is good reason to hold that
they are largely  or entirely  mere after thoughts  any one of ingenious
mind could suggest several others just as worthy of acceptance  but  of
course  such a mode of interpretation is decidedly illegitimate 

the idea has been advanced that the commonest of the species of serpent 
 elaphis   sculapii   described above  at epidaurus  where the myth of the
grecian god of medicine first took definite shape  affords an adequate
explanation of the association of the reptile with medicine  this may
have had a little to do with it  i cannot admit  however  that it did
more than  perhaps  emphasize somewhat the association  if such were its
origin  the association could not be viewed otherwise than as incidental 
and hence the serpent might be without any special meaning 

after referring to some strange curative virtue attributed to
serpents  pliny says     hence it is that the snake is consecrated to
  sculapius          here is a specimen of them given by the rather
credulous old roman     it is a well known fact that for all injuries
inflicted by serpents  and those even of an otherwise incurable nature 
it is an excellent remedy to apply the entrails of the serpent itself to
the wound          the principle is obviously the same as that illustrated
in the old custom of applying a hair of the dog to cure the wound caused
by the bite of the animal  in many parts of the world  the serpent has
been accorded great virtue as a medicine  and in china and elsewhere
such is the case even to this day  in fact  apart from the preposterous
and numerous uses to which it is put by hom  opathic doctors  is not the
venom of the most deadly species declared by leading members of the
profession to be a capital cure for various serious ills  however 
dr  d  g  brinton quotes the rather striking observation of agassiz 
that    the maues indians  who live between the upper tapajos and madeira
rivers in brazil  whenever they assign a form to any    remedio     give it
that of a serpent          but  in spite of the wide belief in the virtue
of the serpent as a medicine  i cannot accept the opinion of pliny 
that it affords a sufficient explanation of the matter in question  its
actual healing properties were assuredly too equivocal to merit such
distinction  with all its virtues   soma  itself received little or no
more 

the fabled power of the serpent to discover herbs of curative virtues
has been suggested as an explanation of the association of it with
medicine  this is based on a traditional episode in the history of
  sculapius  which reminds one of the german story of the snake leaves 
told by grimm       as regards the   sculapian fable  it seems that on one
occasion  while thinking what treatment to resort to in the case of a
patient of his  glaucus  a serpent appeared and twined itself around his
staff  he killed it  whereupon another came bearing in its mouth an herb
with which it restored the dead one to life  the god used the same herb
with similar effect on the human subject       the extremely miraculous
feature of this explanation is an obstacle in the way of its acceptance 

it may be safely held that one must go back to a time long anterior to
that of   sculapius of the greeks to acquire the true medical import of
the serpent  which has been so closely associated with him  there is
excellent reason for believing that we have in it a remnant of that
ancient and wonderfully wide spread cultus  serpent worship  which is
still kept up by the nagas      of india and others  epidaurus was
favorably situated for communication with egypt  a country in which the
serpent played a great religious r  le    from the very earliest period    
as shown by both    written and monumental evidence     to use the words of
cooper       as well as in later times  even within the christian era 
when the special sect of gnostics  who called themselves ophit    were in
their glory  but  in truth  serpent worship in greece did not begin in
the time of   sculapius  bryant maintains that it was brought into greece
by cadmus  who  under the name of taautus  or thoth  took it also to both
egypt and ph  nicia from babylonia      

one can advance sufficient evidence to indicate with considerable
conclusiveness that the egyptians were in the habit of looking to a
serpentine divinity for the cure of disease  in his interesting little
book       sharpe gives a figure of a serpent wearing the double
crown of upper and lower egypt  on a pole or standard  a cut of which
is reproduced  fig      which was carried in the periodical airing
processions of the egyptian divinities  now  it is quite certain that
moses  and his people  too  were very familiar with this figure and its
import  but  at any rate  we find him making an imitation of it  in his
journey with the israelites in the wilderness  and for what purpose  the
story is told in the bible  and runs thus     and moses made a serpent of
brass and put it upon a pole  and it came to pass that if a serpent had
bitten any man  when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived         

verily  there is the healer in essentially the same form in which he was
sometimes embodied by the greeks and romans  hence  it is sure that the
serpent  as a medical symbol  took shape before the time of   sculapius 
long before  for moses lived nearly four hundred years earlier than he 
and  as we have just seen  it was likely far from new  far from being
unfamiliar in his day  fergusson has this to say of it     it is the first
record we have of actual worship being performed to the serpent  and it
is also remarkable  as the cause of this adoration is said to have been
its healing powers         

 illustration  fig       the serpent healer  

the opinion has been widely entertained that the prototype of the brazen
serpent of moses  simply    nehushtan         in later times  was the  bonus
d  mon   the  agathod  mon       of the greeks  egyptians  and others  this
   good genius    was regarded with great favor  and doubtless many were in
the habit of according it power over disease  in the grove of epidaurus 
as in indian temples and elsewhere among early peoples  the serpent was
the  genius loci   and hence the agathod  mon  the bringer of health and
good fortune  the teacher of wisdom  the oracle of future events  one was
kept in the erechtheum  close to the sacred olive tree  and in each of
many other temples  one was to be found  according to ebers     in every
temple         in egypt 

evidence has recently been brought forward which goes to show that
the serpent called the    good genius    in egypt  in general  was in the
part familiar to the israelites  in the district of suket  called also
the dwelling place of ankh     the living one     whose chief city was
piton       regarded as the simulacrum of the sun god ra  or  rather 
atum  tum  or tom  the sun as he sets       brugsch  who has studied
the matter carefully  says     the god tom represents solely the egyptian
type  corresponding to the divinity of piton  who is called by the name
of ankh  and surnamed    the great god        a serpent to which the egyptian
texts give the epithet of    the magnificent        the splendid     was regarded
as the living symbol of the god of piton  it bore the name of kereh 
that is     the smooth     and this serpent again transports us into the
camp of the children of israel in the wilderness  it recalls to us the
brazen serpent of moses  to which the hebrews offered the perfumes of
incense  until the time when king hezekiah      decreed the abolition
of this ancient serpent worship          he further says     i will not
venture to decide the question whether the god     he who lives     of the
egyptian text is identical with the jehovah of the hebrews  but  at all
events  everything tends to this belief when we remember that the name
of jehovah      contains the same meaning as the egyptian word ankh     he
who lives             these are highly interesting statements of this learned
egyptologist 

bearing in mind what has just been said  it is interesting to turn to
what solomon     says about the    brazen serpent     and the cures wrought
by it  in the    book of wisdom     it is spoken of as a symbol     a sign of
salvation          and  it is said     for it was neither herb nor molifying
plaster that healed them  but thy word  o lord  which healeth all
things          and to this it is added     for it was thou  o lord  that
hath power of life and death and leadest down to the gates of death and
bringest back again         

christian writers have generally explained the brazen serpent to be a
symbol of god  or the savior  the writer of the article on medicine 
in smith   s    dictionary of the bible     says that even in the talmud it
is acknowledged    that the healing power lay not in the brazen serpent
itself  but as soon as they feared the most high and uplifted their
hearts to the heavenly father they were healed  and in default of this
they were brought to nought     thus the brazen serpent was symbolical
only  a serpent clinging to a cross was formerly much used as an emblem
of christ  in fact  a sort of christian serpent worship was for a long
period greatly in vogue among many besides the professed ophit   

in this connection it is well to say  that the  naja   haje    naia  
or  asp   the serpent shown in the cut of the brazen serpent  was the
species always  or nearly always  taken to represent the spirit pervading
nature  the agathod  mon  or cnuphis  whom the egyptians were wont to
adore as the creator of the world  it was the ur  us or basiliskos of
the pharaohs  it is from three to five feet in length  it is extremely
venomous  in appearance  it resembles the indian cobra de capello      
but has no spectacle marking on its head  in hieroglyphics it signifies
   goddess    

as to    the serpent of the burning bite which destroyed the children of
israel     i may say  in the words of an authoritative work     either the
cerastes or the naja haje or any other venomous species frequenting
arabia may denote it          the  vipera cerastes  is small  horned 
burrows in sand  and is very venomous  herodotus was led to believe
that it was    perfectly harmless            a great mistake  it was used to
represent the letter f  says sir gardner wilkinson     as herodotus does
not notice the asp  it is possible that he may have attributed to the
cerastes the honor that really belonged to that sacred snake          this
mistake is still frequently made 

but the association of the serpent with   sculapius  as a remnant of
serpent worship  can be explained without going to the egyptian tum  or
any other foreign sun god  one has but to turn to apollo  to whom  as in
the case of  perhaps  all sun gods  the reptile was sacred      

the question now is  then  what was the reason for the association of
the serpent with apollo  the usual reply is  the destruction by him of
the python  which is essentially the same as the aub or ob  or  as it is
often given  typhon  of the egyptians  an evil monster which was probably
taken primarily to represent harm resulting from the periodical overflow
of the nile  homer says    

       with his shining shaft apollo slew
    that ugly dragon  hideous to the view 
    which grew  long nourished in its slimy den 
    a monster horrible  the dread of men         

admitting  however  that apollo overcame a mythical serpent  like many
related divinities  from the vedic sun god  indra  the destroyer of
ahis down  does not afford a satisfactory solution of the matter under
discussion  the agathod  mon is infinitely preferable to typhon as the
prototype of the serpent of   sculapius  it  indeed  was the reptile
sacred to apollo as well as tum 

a study of the origin of the association of the good serpent with apollo
and ra tum and other sun gods is interesting  in the search for it one
may get a clue to it in comparative mythology  the close resemblance to
one another of apollo  ra  baal samen of the ph  nicians  shamas of the
assyrians  and other sun gods  would lead one to think that there was an
archetypal one  and to find this original one the intelligent mind would
naturally look to the east  to the region about the lower waters of the
tigris and euphrates  and with a reasonable expectation of discovering
it there       for among the turanians  in that locality  the worship
of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly first acquired prominence  and in
the same locality  too  among the same people  the worship of serpents 
according to bryant       who has written learnedly on the subject 
began  and  as fergusson says  not only originated but    spread thence 
as from a centre  to every country or land of the old world in which a
turanian people settled          becoming adopted to some extent also by
semites and aryans  from hea  one of the three great gods  ana  hea  and
bel  of the accadio sumerians  and  later  of the people of babylonia 
doubtless sprang some features of the apollo myth  and possibly in
part through horus of the egyptians  to baal samen  the baal of the
heavens  of the ph  nicians  apollo had many points of resemblance  it
has been maintained  however  that apollo was    a pure growth of the greek
mind          he was so in part 

 illustration  fig       a symbol of hea  

speaking of hea  lenormant says that it was he    that animated matter
and rendered it fertile  that penetrated the universe and directed and
inspired it with life          as water was believed to be the vehicle
of all life and the source of generation  he sprung from the ocean and
was regarded as amphibious  oannes      was the name by which he was
known by the greeks  like dagon  of the philistines  whose prototype he
was  it was usual to give him the combined form of a fish and a man 
one of the symbols of him  according to rawlinson       was a serpent 
an illustration of which is reproduced here  he was the god of life 
and  significantly enough  the literal meaning of his name is serpent
as well as life  here  then  we have the serpent signifying life  this
is a very noteworthy fact  in an interesting paper read in      before
the anthropological institute of great britain  by mr  c  s  wake  it is
very properly said     it is probable that the association with the serpent
of the idea of healing arose from the still earlier recognition of that
animal as a symbol of life         

it is not amiss to remark  in this connection  that it is curious fact
that the american indians associated a serpent with the great sun god 
or  rather  the god of light  manabozho       a healing divinity  the
one that instituted the sacred medicine feast  it is observed by miss
emerson that    apollo  as a god of medicine  was originally worshipped
under the form of a serpent       and men worshipped him as a helper  and
we trace a similar idea among the indians relative to manabozho  and a
further association of ideas suggests the mystic god  unk ta he  the god
of waters  pictured as a serpent  who was believed to have power over
diseases          to this i may add that hea sprang from the persian gulf 
and was regarded as the god of waters as well as of life 

 illustration  fig       manabozho  

a great deal has been written on serpent worship     the first variation    
says bryant     from the purer sabaism          and the number of suggested
explanations of the curious cultus is almost legion  i hesitate about
touching on the subject  but some statements on it are called for  to
render the treatment of the matter on hand reasonably complete 

in a recent able work  mr  c  f  keary  of the british museum  presents
some interesting facts and inferences on the origin of the worship 
he maintains that the tree  mountain  and river were the three great
primitive fetich gods  and forcibly argues that a serpent was the symbol
of the last  which  it may be noted  is nearly always a life giving
power  an early and substantial type of the  fontaine de jouvence  
without pretending to account for their original worship  he    takes it
for certain that  at a very early time  rivers became through symbolism
confounded with serpents         

remnants of the three fetich gods of mr  keary are preserved in later
and more abstract cults  and may be largely found in indo european
mythologies  the greeks and romans appear to have regarded rivers and
mountains with particular favor  while the celts and teutons were more
especially devoted to trees  the wells of knowledge and of magic and
the fountains of youth which are met with in myth and legend are simply
the narrowing to particular instances of the magic  the sacredness  and
the healing gifts which were once universally attributed to streams 
the monstrous python which apollo encountered and destroyed at delphi
was  according to mr  keary  a river  and a harmful one    the river of
death     the reptile was  we know     says he     before all things  sacred
to   sculapius  and was kept in his house  as  for example  in the great
temple at epidaurus  it would seem that the sun god has the special
mission of overcoming and absorbing unto himself this form of fetich 
this is why apollo slays the python  and why the snake is sacred to
  sculapius         

mr  keary was by no means the first  i may say  to emphasize the
association of serpents with rivers  the fact has been dwelt on by dr 
brinton  says this distinguished student of american arch  ology     the
sinuous course of the serpent is like nothing so much as that of a
winding river  which  therefore  we often call serpentine  so did the
indians  kennebec  a stream in maine  in the algonkin  means snake 
and antietam  the creek in maryland of tragic celebrity  in an iroquois
dialect  has the same significance  how easily could savages  construing
the figure literally  make the serpent a river  or water god         

i believe  however  that it would be a mistake to hold that the serpent
was at any time exclusively a symbol of the river  both mr  keary and
dr  brinton say as much  in the old world  as well as in the new  it was
widely recognized as a symbol of lightning  and believed to have power
over wind and rain 

some have turned to the heavens for an explanation of serpent worship 
thus  mr  arthur lillie  in an interesting little work  says     like
all old religious ideas  the serpent symbol was  probably  in the
first instance  astronomical       two thousand eight hundred and
thirty six years before christ  a large star was within one degree of
the celestial pole  this was the  a  of draco          much interest was
taken in this star of draco  formerly  as mr  proctor says     the polar
constellation         in different countries       as  for instance  in
egypt  in their studies of the great pyramid jizeh  both proctor and
piazzi smyth      dwell on the subject at length       the passage from
the north  which slants downward at an angle of           into the immense
structure  would seem to have been constructed so that  a  of draco shone
down it  when this was the case  the star was          from the pole 
which was its position both about      and      b c     we conclude     says
proctor     with considerable confidence  that it was about one of the two
dates       and      b c   that the erection of the great pyramid began 
and from the researches of egyptologists it has become all but certain
that the earlier of these dates is very near the correct epoch         
smyth takes      b c  as the correct date  but his unscientific method
of study renders him an unreliable authority  the question is highly
interesting and important 

however  the constellation of draco was represented in ancient astronomy
by a tortuous serpent  either alone or in connection with a tree  those
familiar with the description of the shield of hercules       attributed
to hesiod  and which  it is believed  was suggested by a zodiac
temple      of the chaldeans  imitations of which were to be found in
egypt and elsewhere  will recall the reference to draco       as follows    

       the scaly terror of a dragon coil   d
    full in the central field  unspeakable 
    with eyes oblique  retorted  that aslant
    shot gleaming flame  his hollow jaw was fill   d
    dispersedly with jagged fangs of white 
    grim  unapproachable         

it is hardly to be inferred from this description  i may remark  that
the worship of draco would be one of love  yet  rawlinson says     the
stellar name of hea was kimmut  and it is suspected that in this aspect
he was identified with the constellation draco  which is perhaps the
kimmah      of scripture          this is an interesting statement when
taken in connection with what has been already said about hea  to the
accadians and others the north was a favorable point  being the source of
cool  vivifying breezes 

but  whether from fear or not  draco inspired wide spread attention and
worship  lillie remarks that the serpent of the    three precious gems    of
the buddhist  the serpent  sun  and tree  the a  u  m   is draco at the
pole  the tria ratna  or three precious symbols of the faith  have  in
the representation given  their earliest emblem  except  perhaps  the
swastika       or cross  which was doubtless formed at one time of two
serpents      

 illustration  fig       the buddhist tria ratna  

in the illustration  the serpent represents the male and the staff the
female or negative principle  it has been asserted that we have in it the
prototype of the caduceus of hermes 

the assumption of the serpent as a totem       or symbol  of a family
or tribe has been held   as  for example  by mr  mclennan      and sir
john lubbock        to afford an explanation of the origin and practice of
serpent worship  this honor was no doubt accorded the reptile at a very
early period and in different parts of the world  and it is still done
by the nagas of india and others  in speaking of parium  a city of the
troad  strabo says     it is here the story is related that the ophiogeneis
have some affinity with the serpent tribe     according to fable the
founder of the race of ophiogeneis  a hero  was transformed from a
serpent into a man  he was  perhaps  one of the african psylli     the
power of curing by touch persons bitten by serpents      was claimed by
this tribe  david would seem to have belonged to the serpent family  as
appears from the name of his ancestor  naasson  and it has been suggested
that the brazen serpent found by hezekiah  in the temple of solomon  was
a symbol of it  the friendliness of david to the king of ammon is thus
explained       speaking of rattlesnakes  it is said  in miss emerson   s
work     these creatures were so highly esteemed that to have a serpent as
his totem elevated an indian chief above his brothers         

the fact of the same word meaning both serpent and life has been believed
to cast light on the origin of the worship of serpents  after stating
that the reptile was always a symbol of life and health in egypt and
other countries  the abb   pluche gives as the reason     because among
most of the eastern nations  as the ph  nicians  hebrews  arabians 
and others  with the language of which that of egypt had an affinity 
the word  heve  or  hava  equally signifies the life and the serpent 
the name of  him who is   the great name of god   jov  or  jehova  
thence draws its etymology   heve   or the name of the common mother of
mankind  comes likewise from the same word  life could not be painted 
but it might be marked out by the figure of the animal which bears its
name          according to lenormant       one of the generic names in
the assyrian semitic tongue is  havon   like the arabian  hiyah   both
derived from the root  h  vah   to live  from the same root came the latin
 ave   a wish of good health  and also    vum   the life  the asp still
bears the name of  naja haje  

it is interesting to observe that the american indians  as well as
eastern peoples  made use of the serpent as a symbol of life  the
belief that the animal had power over the fertilizing summer showers
was probably at the bottom of it  as well as its title to god of
fruitfulness  says dr  brinton     because the rattlesnake  the lightning
symbol  is thus connected with the food of man  and itself seems
never to die  but annually to renew its youth  the algonkins called
it    grandfather     and king of snakes  they feared to injure it  they
believed it could grant prosperous breezes or raise disastrous tempests 
crowned with the lunar crescent  it was the constant symbol of life in
their picture writing          in the language of the algonkins and of the
dakotas  the words  manito  and  waken   which express divinity in its
widest sense  also signify serpent 

mr  wake entertains the opinion that the mainspring of serpent worship
was a belief that the animal was really the embodiment of a deceased
human being  or  in other words  that the worship was ancestral in
character  he says     the serpent has been viewed with awe or veneration
from primeval times and almost universally as a re embodiment of
a deceased human being  and as such there were ascribed to it the
attributes of life and wisdom and the power of healing         

but little  however  in what has been said throws much light on the main
point at issue  namely  why the serpent should be yielded worship  the
cause must be sought for  to some extent  in peculiarities of the animal
itself  and it has peculiarities enough  remarkable in form and in mode
of locomotion  and in some species possessed of deadly venom  one might
well regard it with admiration and awe  then  its longevity and apparent
power of renewing its age serve to make it a very extraordinary creature 
the opinion has been expressed      that its power to glide along without
limbs  like the heavenly bodies  was the reason why it was held to be
sacred  no doubt its remarkable power of motion in the absence of limbs
forcibly impressed the ancients       solomon himself said that one of
the four things he could not understand was    the way of a serpent upon a
rock         

herbert spencer maintains that the first step toward the worship of
serpents and other animals was the naming or  rather  nicknaming of men
after creatures to which they bore some points of resemblance  thus  from
having apparently  like holmes   s elsie venner  some of the qualities of a
snake  one might be compared with the animal  and so named after it  then
the descendants  out of regard for their ancestor       might take the
name  or  in other words  accept the snake as their totem 

although the   sculapian serpent was innocent  it was mostly a harmful
species which received worship  the asp of the egyptians and the cobra
of the east indians are decidedly venomous  under the name of  ur  us 
the asp was a symbol of royalty in ancient egypt  ebers makes rameses
say     my predecessors chose the poisonous  ur  us  as the emblem of
their authority  for we can cause death as quickly and as certainly
as the venomous snake          the american indians were devoted to the
rattlesnake  which is extremely venomous  thus  says dr  brinton     the
rattlesnake was the species almost exclusively honored by the red race 
it is slow to attack  but venomous in the extreme  and possesses the
power of the basilisk to attract within its spring small birds and
squirrels          evidently the worship of such reptiles must have been
inspired  in a measure at least  by fear  still  it appears certain 
as the author just quoted believes  that  as employed to express the
divine element in atmospheric and other natural phenomena  it far more
frequently typified what was favorable and agreeable than the reverse 
ebers gives it as his opinion that    mythological figures of snakes have
quite as often a benevolent as a malevolent signification         

a word must be said about the phallic explanation of the origin of
serpent worship  mr  cox  an excellent writer on mythology  is friendly
to this theory  after speaking of the phallus as a symbol  he says 
   when we add that from its physical characteristics the ash  rah  which
the greeks called the phallus  suggested the emblem of the serpent  we
have the key to the tree  and serpent worship          beyond question  a
phallus serpent comes frequently into view in studying mythology  but it
would be very hard to prove that every serpent met with had its prototype
in the phallus  it is to be regarded as beneficent  a life giving power 
the agathod  mon is frequently so represented 

probably the possibility of charming serpents has had something to
do with the remarkable uses to which these animals have been put  a
person who could handle without danger a venomous reptile  and control
its actions at pleasure  might easily lead many to believe him to be
possessed of some miraculous power  aaron resorted to this artifice when
he appeared before pharaoh with his cataleptic serpent  in the form of a
rod      

the reason just given seems better than the one plutarch gives for the
association of the serpent with certain great men  when he says  in
his    life of cleomanes     that it was from a belief that after death
evaporation of    the marrow         produces serpents       that the
ancients appropriated the serpent  rather than any other animal  to
heroes 

i believe it is vain to attempt to trace the origin of serpent worship to
one and the same source  this appears plain when it is remembered that
some serpents represented good  while others stood for the opposite 
evil  the bible furnishes a marked instance of contrasts  in one place
a serpent was used  as has been pointed out  as a symbol of god  or
christ  while elsewhere one represents cunning  envy  lying  and even
   the devil and satan  which deceiveth the whole world          in the
nature of things  one would expect the same species of reptile to
produce a very similar impression on primitive peoples everywhere  this 
probably  accounts largely for the resemblance to one another of most
serpent legends  the different impressions produced by different species
would  to some extent  explain the unlike significance of serpent symbols
among different peoples  the signification  however  was often of very
fanciful origin  as  for example  where a serpent in the form of a circle
symbolized eternity  or  rather  endless life 




chapter x 

various attributes of   sculapius 


in this chapter i will speak briefly of various attributes  more or less
generally accorded to   sculapius  some of them are decidedly significant 
but none so much so as the staff and serpent of which i have fully
treated 

in many  indeed most  of the representations of   sculapius  he is
crowned with a wreath of laurel  this mark of merit  like rays of light
which were given in some instances  has been commonly held to have been
accorded him because he was the son of apollo  to whom the tree was
sacred  according to this view  one has in it a remnant of the oracular
laurel at delphi  another way of accounting for it is  to use the words
of tooke     because that tree is powerful in curing many diseases         
an exaggerated claim  the ancients regarded it as effective against evil
spirits      

a bunch of herbs was at times represented in one of the hands of the
god  this was very appropriate  the district of greece      in which 
according to the legend  he studied under chiron  was famous for its
medicinal plants 

a bowl was occasionally shown in connection with figures of   sculapius 
it was indicative of the administration by him of medicinal potions 

a scroll was an attribute of some   sculapian figures  it is an admirable
one for an ideal physician  in modern times it should certainly be
regarded as an indispensable one  medicine has been evolved from recorded
experience  and its progress is dependent on the same 

an unpublished discovery of any kind is  in a manner  none at all 
curiously enough the name of the egyptian god of medicine  imhotep 
means     i bring the offering     the ideograph for  hotep   or offering 
being a papyrus roll 

 illustration  fig        telesphorus  

i will now say a few words about a remarkable attribute of some
representations of the god of medicine  i refer to telesphorus 
euemerion  or acesius       a small figure  a boy  but not a son  as is
sometimes stated  as will be seen in the cut of him given  and which is
copied from one given by tooke       as seen in a statue in the louvre 
he is wrapped in a mantle and is barefooted  figures of him  however 
vary considerably in appearance  in him we have  according to some  a
sort of d  mon or familiar spirit  such as that which socrates is said to
have had  it is better  i think  to regard him as a genius       meant to
symbolize the hidden sustaining vital force  the  vis medicatrix natur    
or  anima medica   upon which greatly depends the recovery of the sick 
it has been suggested that the careful wrapping may be intended to
indicate the need of such protection during convalescence 

the dog was prominent in connection with the epidaurian and other statues
of   sculapius  the fidelity and watchfulness of this friendly animal
render it a very fit attribute of the god  the part played with the goat 
according to the legend  has been taken by some to afford an explanation
of the connection  another is furnished by the name  which  as will be
pointed out in the next chapter  apparently means man dog 

the parsis believed that dogs with four eyes could drive away the
death fiend  but such not being procurable  one    with two spots above
the eyes    was used for the purpose  in their great sacred book       the
animal is represented to be the special one of ormazd  herodotus states
that the magi do not hesitate to kill all animals     excepting dogs and
men         

the oriental mardux  in whom was assimilated the more ancient
silik mulu khi  a healing divinity  was attended by dogs  as was nimrod 
the hunter  with whom he may have been identical      

the cock  as well as the dog  was a prominent attribute in many
representations of   sculapius  this alert bird  a bird watchful of the
returning light  was very properly associated with a sun god  it was a
common object of sacrifice to the god  by patients who were grateful
for relief or cure  socrates has  through plato  made this memorable 
said the dying sage  as he felt his limbs growing cold     when the poison
reaches the heart  that will be the end     feeling his body gradually
losing its vital heat  and realizing that relief from his troubles was at
hand  he said  as he passed away     crito  i owe a cock to   sculapius 
will you remember to pay the debt        the debt shall be paid     responded
his friend      

the practice of sacrificing      a cock for the restoration of health
was not exclusively practiced by the votaries of   sculapius  in his
   life of pyrrhus  king of epirus     plutarch says that    a white cock    was
sacrificed generally by each of the patients he touched    for swelling
of the spleen     the full quotation will be given in a succeeding
chapter  the bird is still sacrificed in some parts of scotland and
other countries  for the removal of at least one disease    epilepsy  dr 
mitchell  of edinburgh  states that the practice is very familiar to
him  in the northern part of his native country     on the spot     says he 
   where the epileptic first falls  a black cock is buried alive  along
with a lock of the patient   s hair and some parings of his nails         

there is yet another animal associated with the god of medicine    the
goat  it was especially by the cyrenians that the connection was much
emphasized  pausanias remarks that    the cyrenians sacrifice goats 
although this rite was not delivered by the epidaurians          still 
as already pointed out  on epidaurian coins    sculapius was represented
sucking a goat    an illustration of the legend 

why the goat was connected in sacrifice with the god is explained by
tooke thus     a goat is always in a fever  and  therefore  a goat   s
constitution is very contrary to health          shakespeare  in    king
lear     uses the phrase    goatish disposition    in reference to a
   whoremaster man     the fabled satyrs were in part goats in form  i am not
aware that there was anything of the biblical scape goat principle     
about the sacrifice  a superstition similar to the one which prevailed
   all over egypt     as we are told by herodotus       of praying that evils
impending over the people might fall on the head of the sacrificial
victim  and then casting it into the nile  if there was no greek at hand
to whom it could be sold 

the great prominence of the goat in the   sculapian rites in cyrene may
have been due  to some extent at least  to the proximity of egypt  a
country in which the animal played a prominent part  in the goat of
mendes       the incarnation of khem or min  was personified  says
lenormant     in the most brutish manner the reproductive power          both
the goat and the cock were often associated with the egyptian hermes 

i may add that the cause of the association of the goat with   sculapius
has been referred to the name  the abb   banier states the case thus 
    es  or  ex   which begins the name of the god  signifies a goat in the
language of the ph  nicians       and  with a little variation  the same
thing in greek       and this had given rise to the fable of   sculapius
being nursed by that animal         




chapter xi 

gods analogous to   sculapius 


the great eminence acquired by the   sculapian myth among the grecians
might reasonably lead to the belief that it was one entirely special to
that imaginative people  like many other gods  however  of both high
and low degree  this one was only in part    to the manor born     there is
good ground for believing that there was what might justly be called a
prototype of the divinity of much repute in both ph  nicia and egypt 
dr  mayo does not hesitate to say that      sculapius was actually known
in the oriental countries before he was in greece  whither his worship
was brought from ph  nicia by the colony of cadmus and from egypt by that
of danaus          it is not improbable that the main conception of the
healing god did really long antedate not only the grecian but both the
ph  nician and egyptian embodiments of it  evidence of this will be found
later in the chapter 

the esmun    the eighth    of the ph  nicians  especially worshipped at
berytus       has been regarded      as essentially the same as the
grecian   sculapius  he was probably that and something more  little
definite is known of this personage  of whom the serpent was a symbol 
save what we are told of him in the fragment of an historical work by
sanchoniathon  preserved by eusebius  an early christian writer     to
sydyk  called the just     it is said     one of the titanides      bore
esmun          he is represented to have been the eighth and chief of those
spared by the deluge  and also of the cabiri  or cabeiri          the seven
sons of sydyk          the mighty ones  named  it has been said       after
mountains in phrygia  and divinities widely  but in general secretly 
adored  in ph  nicia  carthage       egypt       and elsewhere 

the belief has been expressed that noah and his family and the cabiri
were originally the same       mr  faber entertained this view  and
it is fully set forth by him in an interesting work    one  by the way 
in which is ably presented the so called arkite symbolism       which
has excited considerable attention  but which mr  tylor  as well as
many others  declares to be    arrant nonsense          in reference to
  sculapius he says     this deity connects the first and second tables of
the ph  nician genealogies  his father  sydyk  occupying a conspicuous
place in the one  while his mother  titanis  is enumerated among the
daughters of cronus  in the other  i am much inclined to think that the
imaginary god of health is in reality the very same person as his reputed
father  sydyk  both of them being equally the patriarch  noah  worshipped
in connection with the sun  macrobius  accordingly  informs us that
  sculapius was one of the many names of the solar deity  and that he was
usually adored along with salus  or the moon       salus  however  was
no less a personification of the ark than of the moon  those two objects
of idolatrous veneration being allied to each other in consequence of
the union of the arkite and sabian superstitions  thus  while noah
was revered as the god of health and as one of the eight cabiri  the
vessel in which he was preserved was honored with the title of salus  or
safety         

lenormant regards the cabiri as the seven planets of the ancients  that
is  the sun  moon  jupiter  saturn  mars  venus  and mercury     esmun    
says he     invisible to mortal eyes  was supposed to be the connecting
link of the seven others and the one approaching nearest to the
primordial baal       he presided over the whole sideral system  and was
supposed to preside over the laws and harmonies of the universe  and in
this respect was the same as taaut         

although secret  the worship of the cabiri was participated in by persons
of either sex and of all ages  in lemnos and other places the fires were
put out  sacrifices to the dead were made  and fire was brought from
delos in a sacred vessel and given to the people  who  with it  began a
new and regenerated existence  phallic rites formed an inseparable part
of the worship  which was indulged in at stated periods 

as showing that   sculapius was of ph  nician origin  mr  faber lays
emphasis on the fact that in the edition of virgil by servius the line
telling of the destruction of the god makes him a ph  nician    

        fulmine p  nigenam stygias detrusit ad undas          

the usual and  doubtless  the right reading makes  p  nigenam  
 ph  bigenam  

the opinion that   sculapius was essentially the same as anubis among the
early egyptians has been advanced  both were viewed as simply divine
personifications of sirius  or sothis  the dog star       this view is
well presented by m  pluche 

a study of the name        sculapius may or may not afford evidence in
favor of the idea that there was originally a connection between the god
and the dog star  although decidedly a grecian god  asklepios does not
appear to be a greek word  keightly goes so far as to say     of his name
no satisfactory derivation has as yet been offered          he ventures 
however  to suggest that it may be from the root               the original
meaning of which may have been to cut  whence the latin  scalpo  and our
own word  scalpel   mr  keightly forgot that the name was not necessarily
greek  for that  like nearly all others  was largely a derivative
language  in the greek as well as the latin form  it may be hebrew  or 
what was essentially the same  ph  nician  taking it to be compounded of
 esh    aish    isch   or  ish        a man  and  caleb         caleph  
or  culap   a dog  the literal meaning of it is  vir canis   or man dog 
but  as some remarks already made indicate  it may be interpreted to mean
 goat dog       

anubis  anup  or anupu  who in very early times was possibly the same as
thoth  was regarded as symbolic of that brightest of the fixed stars 
sirius     the burning     whose first appearance in the morning was the
signal of the advent of the warm season  and the etesian or periodic wind
from the north  as well as the beginning of the year       the rising
of this notable star heliacally   that is  with the sun        told the
egyptians to prepare at once for the overflow of the waters of the nile 
by many it was believed to be the cause of the flood  the watch dog was
evidently a very appropriate symbol for this star of warning  then  from
the fact that sirius gave warning of danger  and thus saved the lives
of the people  to the symbols of it the serpent  the life symbol  was
often and very properly attached     on this account it was     says pluche 
   that anubis and   sculapius passed for the inventors of physic and the
preservers of life         

others besides the egyptians regarded sirius with favor       as  for
example  the parsis  to whom it was    tystria  the bright and glorious
star          in greece  however  it was not regarded as propitious  to it
were attributed certain diseases  thus  homer  who calls it orion   s dog 
says    

                                       his burning breath
    taints the red air with fevers  plagues  and death         

remembering the medical history of sirius  it is worth while recalling
that the    dog days     those extending from about the   d of july to the
  d of august  are often spoken of as the physician   s holiday 

 illustration  fig        anubis  

one very often hears that thoth was to the egyptians the god of medicine 
just as   sculapius was to the greeks and romans  even the late dr  aitken
meigs  a scholarly physician  accepted this idea  in an address  to be
referred to later  he says       sculapius is  doubtless  the egyptian
thoth  or hermes trismegistus  whose symbols  the staff and twining
serpent  surmounted with the mystic hawk of horus ra and the solar
ur  us       appear in the ancient temple pselcis  near dakkeh  in nubia    
the doctor is about as wide of the mark as forbes winslow  when he says
that the grecian    apollo and minerva answered to the isis and osiris of
the egyptians  and orpheus  the priest  poet  and physician  usurped the
place of thoth         

hermes  thoth  or thot  the tet or taautes of the ph  nicians  was not the
god of medicine among the egyptians  any more than he was the god of any
other special branch of knowledge  he was the patron god of all kinds of
learning 

says ebers     the discovery of nearly every science is attributed to the
ibis headed god  thoth  the writer or clerk of heaven  whom the greeks
compared to their god  hermes         

it is no doubt true  however  that hermes was credited with taking
considerable interest in medical matters  he was said to have been the
author of six books on the healing art  in which anatomy  pathology  and
therapeutics were treated of  together with diseases of the eye    a part
of the body which has always suffered much in egypt  ebers remarks that
   the book on the use of medicine has been preserved to the present day in
the    papyrus ebers            

having referred to the    papyrus ebers     it may be well to say a few
words about it  it was discovered a few years ago by the learned and
versatile egyptologist  herr ebers  and is the best preserved of all the
ancient egyptian manuscripts extant  it was written at sais during the
eighteenth dynasty  that is  in the sixteenth century before our era  it
consists of     pages  in it we have the hermetic medical work of the
ancient egyptians  with the contents of which the alexandrian greeks
were familiar  the god thoth is called in it    the guide    of physicians 
and the composition of it is attributed to him  this venerable document
treats of many internal and external diseases of most parts of the body 
special attention is given to the visual organs  drugs belonging to all
the kingdoms of nature are used  and with those prescribed are numbers
according to which they are weighed with weights and measured with hollow
vessels  accompanying the prescriptions are noted the pious axioms to
be repeated by the physician while compounding and giving them to the
patient  the german government has published the work in  fac simile  
a copy of which i have examined  there is a copy of it  i think  in the
astor library  new york 

medicine certainly consisted of more than charms and the like  at a very
early period  in egypt  indeed  in the remains of manetho   s history of
the country  it is said of the successor of menes  the first king of
the first dynasty  which dates back to about      years before our era 
   athothis  his son  reigned    years  he built the palaces at memphis 
and left the anatomical books  for he was a physician          the custom
of embalming the dead necessarily led to at least a rough knowledge of
the anatomy of the body 

sesostris  or sesortosis  the second king of the third dynasty  sometimes
gets credit for being    the actual founder of medicine          manetho
says of him     he is called asclepius by the egyptians  for his medical
knowledge         

according to herodotus and diodorus  medical practice was carried on in
a highly rational way at an early period in egypt  mr  sayce ventures
to say that in the period of the eighteenth dynasty medicine was    in
almost as advanced a state as in the age of galen  the various diseases
known were carefully distinguished from one another  and their symptoms
were minutely described  as well as their treatment  the prescriptions
recommended in each case are made out in precisely the same way as the
prescriptions of a modern doctor          mr  sayce bases these statements
on the    papyrus ebers     however  we are informed by herodotus that
specialists were common when he visited the country  which was about
    years before our era  but this must not be accepted as proof that
medicine was necessarily in a very advanced state  here is what the
grecian historian says     medicine is practiced among them on a plan of
separation  each physician treats a single disorder  and no more  thus 
the country swarms with medical practitioners  some undertaking to cure
diseases of the eye  others  of the head  others  again  of the teeth 
others  of the intestines  and some  those which are not local         
as to their philosophy of morbid conditions  he says     they have a
persuasion that every disease to which men are liable is occasioned by
substances whereon they feed     this doctrine led them    to purge the body
by means of emetics and clysters    for    three successive days in each
month         

in respect to medical specialism in egypt  i may further say that 
according to ebers       as early as      before our era  any one
requiring a physician sent for him  not to his house  but to the
temple  there a statement was obtained from the messenger concerning
the complaint from which the sick person was suffering  and then it was
left to the principal of the medical staff of the sanctuary to select
that master of the healing art whose special knowledge and experience
qualified him to be best suited for the treatment of the case  no
honorarium was expected from the patient  the fee was paid by the state 

according to canon rawlinson  it is an open question whether  as is often
said  the physicians of ancient egypt formed a special division of the
sacerdotal order     though  no doubt  some of the priests were required
to study medicine          it is interesting to connect with this the
following statement from an authoritative work     there is no sign in the
homeric poems of the subordination of medicine to religion  which is seen
in ancient egypt and india         

it has been asserted that    medicine in egypt was a mere art  or
profession          that this assertion is ridiculously untrue any one
knows who is competent to form an opinion on medical subjects  and who
has read the pentateuch  moses  whose learning was egyptian  had a
wonderful knowledge of hygiene    the most important part of medicine  the
manner of dealing with contagious diseases described in the thirteenth
and fourteenth chapters of leviticus is far in advance of our practice
to day  so intent were the egyptians on knowing the nature of diseases
that  post mortem  examinations were  it is said by pliny  resorted to
for the purpose  unlike the religion of the hebrews  theirs did not teach
them to dread touching the dead  but one has the authority of celsus
for saying that the latter physicians  those of the alexandrian school 
were not satisfied with the dissection of the dead  they went so far as
to make  ante mortem  examinations of criminals  in truth  mr  sayce
properly observes that it was    in medicine that egypt attained any real
scientific eminence         

jeremiah  speaking of    the daughter of egypt     says     in vain shalt
thou use many medicines  for thou shalt not be cured          this remark
indicates that the skillful use of medicines by the egyptians was widely
noised abroad over five centuries before our era  both cyrus and darius
sent to egypt for physicians       hippocrates  however  who lived nearly
two centuries later than the prophet  gives no prominence to egyptian
medicine  but much earlier  indeed  than this time  it is evident from
the works of homer that it was in repute among the greeks  thus  to
remove the grief and rage caused by the death of brave antilochus  we are
told that the famous helen of sparta  who takes on the occasion the r  le
of  une femme m  decin     

       mix   d a mirth inspiring bowl 
    temper   d with drugs of sovereign power t    assuage
    the boiling bosom of tumultuous rage 
       
    these drugs so friendly to the joys of life
    bright helen learn   d from thone   s imperial wife      
    who sway   d the sceptre  where prolific nile
    with various simples clothes the fatten   d soil         

again  it is said of the pharian or egyptian race    

       from p  on sprung  their patron god imparts
    to all the pharian race his healing arts         

such statements as those just made would seem to render it more than
probable that not a little of grecian medicine was of egyptian origin 
pliny  indeed  says that it was claimed that the study of medicine was
begun in egypt       blakie  however  ventures to affirm that    the
knowledge of medicine came to the greeks originally from thessaly  one
of the earliest seats of hellenic civilization  as is evident from the
pedigree of coronis          at any rate  it is certain that  for some time
before and after the beginning of the christian era  alexandria was a
great medical centre  there it was that herophilus and erasistratus lived
and imperishably distinguished themselves two centuries or so b c 

but i must return to hermes  from whom i have been wandering  perhaps 
too far and too long  although i am not disposed to give the medical
position to him that some have questionably done  i deem it wise to
say a few words especially about him  lenormant believes that he was
originally the angel of baal  mal  k baal  who  like him  assimilated with
the agathod  mon       it is generally believed that he came to egypt from
ph  nicia       he was usually represented      with the head of  not a
hawk  but an ibis  a heart shaped bird with the plumage white  except
the pinions and tail  which are black  and with long legs and beak  the
latter crooked  this bird was the symbol of him made use of in writing 
both it      and a species      black in color are well described by
herodotus  mummified specimens of it are to be seen in an excellent state
of preservation in museums  as  for instance  in that of the academy of
natural sciences of philadelphia 

i may observe in this connection that an ibis society would be the same
as a hermes society  neither title is very suitable for a medical one  i
have heard of an ibex society  but  of course  the ibis and the ibex are
entirely different creatures 

horus himself  whose    face is in the shape of the divine hawk          and
who  in some respects  resembles apollo  was believed to possess medical
power       murray even says     horus was reputed to have been deeply
versed in the practice of medicine  and  accordingly  was compared with
  sculapius         

chonsu  or chonsu nefer hotep       the son of amun and mut  the third of
the great theban triad  was regarded as a healing divinity  says tiele 
   he was resorted to for the cure of all diseases  or for the exorcism of
all the evil spirits who inflict them          he resembled thoth somewhat 

 illustration  fig        thoth  

from the third century before our era forward serapis was highly esteemed
for his healing power       he was in part a grecian conception  being
first prominent in pontus  and his worship became popular in many
sections of greece and rome  but alexandria was his chief seat  and
his serapeum there was of great magnificence and renown       he was
represented in various ways  often as a man encircled by a serpent 

the special personage corresponding to   sculapius  among the egyptians 
would seem to have been imhotep  eimopth  imothph  eimothph  or emeph 
a god whose shrine was first discovered by salt       the egyptologist 
at phil    a greek inscription on the shrine reads       sculapius  who is
imuthes  son of vulcan     in accordance with the inscription  sir erasmus
wilson says     imhotep  the imuthes of the greeks  corresponded with their
  sculapius          ebers  probably the best of authorities on the subject 
says of imhotep     he was the son of ptah  and named asklepios by the
greeks  memphis      was the chief city of his worship  he is usually
represented with a cap on his head and a book on his knee  there are
fine statues of him at berlin  the louvre  and other museums          it
is said by tiele that    he is a personification of the sacrificial fire    
that    the texts designate him as the first of the cher hib     a class of
priests who were at the same time choristers and physicians  for the
sacred hymns were believed to have a magical power as remedies  and that
his worship  although of ancient date     does not seem ever to have taken
a prominent place         

of imhotep i may further say  in the way of biography  that he was the
son of ptah and sekhet  and was possibly a king of the sixth dynasty  in
the egyptian system of mythology  ptah     he who forms     the god of fire 
was regarded as the father of the gods and the great artificer of the
world  he bore a resemblance to heph  stus       a god  indeed  who had
the gift of healing 

after all  it is necessary to say that there is but little evidence
to establish the claim of imhotep to the title of god of medicine  as
kenrick says     he has no attribute which specially refers to the art
of healing  and it may be an arbitrary interpretation of the greeks
which gave him the name of   sculapius  as some applied the same to
serapis          whether he was a medical worthy or not  it appears from
quotations from his teachings given in a song  recently translated from a
papyrus in the british museum  that he was of decidedly epicurean views 
   fulfill     says he     thy desire whilst thou livest     and again     feast in
tranquility  seeing that there is no one who carries away his good things
with him         

however  as a matter of interest  i will give the name of the god in
the egyptian characters       the double reed stands for a long  i   or
 ei   the owl for  m   and the other three figures   the table  semicircle 
and square   for  h   t   p   as will be observed  the  o  and  e  of the
ideographic combination   hotep        are not given  the reason of this
is  that in writing  the egyptians  like the hebrews and others  commonly
omitted the vowels  except at the beginning and end of words  the meaning
of the name is rendered by bunsen     i come with the offering         

an early aryan divinity has been stated to be an analogue or even the
prototype of   sculapius  mr  faber refers to captain wilford as holding
that the classical health and life restorer    is the hindoo aswiculapa 
or the chief of the race of the horse  and he further intimates that
aswiculapa was very nearly related to the two hero gods who are evidently
the same as castor and pollux  these were believed to be the children of
the sun and the goddess devi  the sun at the time of their intercourse
having assumed the form of a horse and devi that of a mare          he
hardly presents the real opinion expressed by the captain  but  at any
rate  what he has to say is not extremely important      

 illustration  fig        imhotep  

the aswi  asvi  or asvins were two  and were possibly the prototypes of
the dioscuri       castor and pollux  they were connected with the sun as
horses  taking them to be forms of the dioscuri  they might be related to
the two sons of   sculapius  machaon and podalirius  for these have been
regarded as such       nothing more than a specific form of the dioscuri     to
use the words of de gubernatis       the conception of chiron may have
been in part derived from the asvins 

the asvins were worshipped from an early period by the hindus  reference
to them being made in the oldest hymns  cox says of them     as ushering
in the healthful light      of the sun  they are like asclepios and his
children  healers and physicians  and their power of restoring the aged
to youth re appears in medeia  the daughter of the sun          in the
   rig veda    they are characterized as    givers of happiness          and are
said    to be most ready to come to the aid of the destitute          they
were believed to be conversant with all medicaments 

thrita of the parsis  the trita of the hindus  is a remarkable healing 
semi divine personage  of whom a great deal is said in the    zend avesta   
and other sacred books of aryan peoples of the east  according to the
   zend avesta     which is from a common source with the    vedas     he is the
curer of the diseases caused by the great evil spirit  ahriman  in the
   vedas    he is said to extinguish illness in men as the gods extinguished
it in him  and he can grant long life  he drinks s  ma  as did indra  to
acquire strength to kill the demon vritra 

in the parsi system of religion  thrita received from the supreme god 
ahura mazda       ten thousand healing plants  which had been growing
around the tree of life  the white h  m       the s  ma of the hindus 

thrita appears to have been one of the first priests of the personified
source of life and health       the enlivening  healing  fair  lordly 
golden eyed h  oma          the destruction of a great serpent  azi dah  ka 
the most dreadful drug       created by angra mainyu  himself a serpent 
to which diseases were attributed  was one of his fabled feats 

there is much that is interesting to the physician in the    zend avesta    
but i cannot present it here  one interesting passage i may quote 
ahura mazda is addressed thus     o maker of the material world  thou holy
one  if a worshipper of mazda want to practice the art of healing  on
whom shall he first prove his skill  on the worshippers of mazda  or on
the worshippers of the d  vas          the reply is     on the worshippers of
the d  vas he shall first prove himself     if on these the surgeon use the
knife three times with success     then is he fit to practice the art of
healing for ever and ever         

 illustration  fig        silik mulu khi       

silik mulu khi  the son of hea  was a remarkable divinity  of whom i
feel it desirable to speak  in him we have one kindly disposed toward
man  a special friend of humanity  largely medical in character  what
he was has been unveiled  mainly of late  through the decipherment of
cuneiform inscriptions  the babylonians prized him highly       he became
assimilated with mardux       or marodach  of the babylono assyrians 
and bel  of later times       space forbids me to give a long account of
him  much can be learned about him  passim  in the admirable works of m 
fran  ois lenormant       and in the    records of the past         

silik mulu khi   that is     he who distributes good among men           was  as
already stated  the son of hea  to whom he remained subject  he overcame
the dragon of the deep  and is spoken of as the redeemer of mankind  the
restorer of life  and the raiser from the dead  he took shape among the
accadio sumerians 

hea  or ea          the master of the eternal secrets        the god who
presides over theurgical action     revealed to silik mulu khi    the
mysterious rite  the formula  or the all powerful hidden name which shall
thwart the efforts of the most formidable powers of the abyss          like
apollo  he had special medical functions  indeed  mr  sayce observes that
   he was emphatically the god of healing  who had revealed medicine to
mankind         

as the symbol of his office  silik mulu khi carried a reed  which took
the place of both the royal sceptre and magic wand  and which was
transmitted to the assyrian mardux       in a hymn it is said    

       golden reed  great reed  tall reed of the marshes  sacred bed of
        the gods 
       
    i am the messenger of silik mulu khi  who causes all to grow young
        again         

although silik mulu khi   s functions were largely medical  it is not to be
supposed that he resorted much to the use of medicaments  for it has not
yet been made very apparent that medicine  properly so called  was much
esteemed by the early babylono assyrian peoples  not long ago mr  h  f 
talbot  in an interesting article on assyrian talismans and exorcisms 
said     diseases were attributed to the influence of spirits  exorcisms
were used to drive away those tormentors  and this seems to have been the
sole remedy employed  for i believe that no mention has yet been found of
medicine          this statement does not hold good now  as will be shown
later      

in the cure of diseases the babylono assyrian practitioners first duly
guarded the entrance to the patient   s chamber  images or guardian statues
of hea and silik mulu khi were placed one to the right and the other to
the left  texts were put on the threshold and on the statues  after the
manner spoken of in deuteronomy       these were also placed on the brow
of the patient and about the room  in bad cases recourse was had to the
   mamit     something which the evil spirits could not resist  talbot gives
the following prescription from an accadian tablet    

       take a white cloth  in it place the mamit in the sick man   s right
        hand 
    and take a black cloth and wrap it round his left hand 
    then all the evil spirits  and the sins which he has committed 
    shall quit their hold of him and shall never return         

m  lenormant gives a translation of an interesting magic tablet  here is
a passage from it which the conjurer  the shaman  is supposed to speak 
ending with the usual adjuration    

       disease of the bowels  the disease of the heart 
    the palpitation of the heart 
    disease of the vision  disease of the head 
    malignant dysentery
    the humor which swells 
    ulceration of the veins  the micturition which wastes      
    cruel agony which never ceases 
    nightmare    
    spirit of the heavens       conjure it 
    spirit of the earth       conjure it         

what follows is part of an incantation against    the diseases of the
head       

       the diseases of the head  like doves to their dove cots  like
        grasshoppers into the sky 
    like birds into space    
    may they fly away 
    may the invalid be replaced in the protecting hands of his
        god         

here is the remedy for    diseases of the head     as given by hea to
silik mulu khi    

       come my son  silik mulu khi 
    take a sieve  draw some water from the surface of the river 
    place thy sublime lip upon the water 
    make it shine with purity from thy sublime breath     
    help the man  son of his god    
    let the disease of his head depart 
    may the disease of his head be dispersed like a nocturnal dew         

i have already stated that silik mulu khi became in time assimilated with
the god possessing beauty or splendor  mardux       here are extracts
from a hymn addressed to him after the change    

       merciful one among the gods 
    generator who brought back the dead to life 
    silik mulu khi  king of heaven and of earth 
       
    to thee is the lip of life 
    to thee are death and life 
    i have invoked thy name  i have invoked thy sublimity 
       
    may the invalid be delivered from his disease 
    cure the plague  the fever  the ulcer         




chapter xii 

the pine cone as an attribute of   sculapius 


the fruitful results of studies in oriental history  industriously and
intelligently pursued by able and learned men in recent times  are making
more and more apparent the borrowed character of many features of the
civilization of greece and other western nations  greek  latin  german 
irish  and other languages of the indo european races  have been shown
to be largely derived from sanskrit  or a source similar to it  and the
various mythologies have also been proved to be more or less evolutions 

of late  the assyrians  babylonians  and accadio sumerians  but
especially the last  who were  as is said in the bible  both    a mighty   
and    an ancient nation          have been accorded a greater influence
than formerly on other peoples  there is little or no ground for doubt
that the first forms of belief  as well as art  came from the east  it
is certain that in the fertile region  about the lower waters of the
euphrates and tigris  there was  at very early period  a remarkable
unfoldment of intellectual  social  and other elements of progress  from
the savage state  the ideas brought with them three thousand years or
more before our era  to the rich plains southward of mesopotamia  and
gathered there by the early inhabitants of the hills of elam and their
kin  the earlier inhabitants of sumer       have been potent everywhere
to the westward 

these turanians  a dark complexioned people  were conquered by the
semites settled in parts to the west of babylonia  by whom their culture
and civilization were appropriated      

the accadio sumerians undoubtedly gave direction and shape to the
religions of babylonia  assyria  ph  nicia  and other countries  including
egypt  this means a great deal  for in the earlier stages of civilization
the religion  such as it may be  is a matter of the greatest possible
significance  both in itself and its influence on everything else  the
language of the accadio sumerians long served as the sacred one in
babylonia and assyria       and has been characterized by mr  sayce as
   the sanskrit of the turanian family          in it are the important early
cuneiform inscriptions  all the originals of which were written eighteen
hundred years or so before our era 

the medical ideas of the accadio sumerian were closely related to his
religion  to him the cause and cure of disease were  to a great extent 
in fact essentially  supernatural affairs  and thus  indeed  it has been
among all early peoples  nor is it probable that it will ever be entirely
otherwise anywhere  the same feelings which prompted the dweller in
elam  or in the plains to the westward  to formulate his religion and
philosophy are still experienced by humanity  even the myth formers are
not all dead  the spirit of all the mythologies is yet alive  there are
gods of fancy to day  as there were when ana and hea and bel were in the
ascendant  and they are not very different  the  nomen   the name  may
vary much  but the  numen   the thing  for the most part  does not 

the science of the nineteenth century has not cleared away from the
minds of a large majority  in even the most highly civilized nations 
the belief that health and sickness are largely subject to mysterious
spiritual powers  they are matters of which the populace are still apt to
entertain preposterous notions  cullen well remarks somewhere that he had
found even men with trained logical faculties  such as lawyers  satisfied
with reasons of any kind  advanced to explain medical phenomena  and in
truth the physician deals with matters not readily understood  in the
very first paragraph of his book of books  has not hippocrates himself
said     experience is fallacious and judgment difficult    

however  it is not to be denied that there are many who sincerely and
firmly believe that both health and disease are entirely dependent on the
will of spiritual powers  doubtless every physician has seen instances
of perfect resignation  on the death of even a near relative  brought
about by the notion that the bereavement was    the will of god     an
innocent child  cut off by diphtheria  or scarlet fever  or some other
pestilential disease  which exists only by tolerance  with a tearless
mother bending over it  calm and full of the idea that it was the will
of the almighty to destroy it in the bud  as it were  is not an uncommon
sight  and one which cannot fail to impress both deeply and sadly the
intelligent observer  impious and erroneous doctrine  to be sure  but 
nevertheless  part and parcel of many  nay  most of the creeds of the
day 

my statements are not rashly made and baseless  i might almost ask in
vain for a creed in which an absolute declaration of the life and death
of mortals being entirely in the hands of supra mundane powers is not
made  for example  in the chapter of the    book of common prayer     on
   the order for the visitation of the sick     it is said     dearly beloved 
know this  that almighty god is the lord of life and death  and of all
things to them pertaining  as youth  strength  health  age  weakness 
and sickness  wherefore  whatsoever your sickness be  know you certainly
that it is god   s visitation     for relief  the means is indicated in this
petition     o lord  look down from heaven  behold  visit  and relieve this
thy servant     there is no doubt about the meaning of these passages  and
it is certain that the ideas contained in them are essentially those
which were current among various peoples of remote antiquity  of course 
to one who sincerely entertains such ideas there can be no such thing
as a science and art of medicine  but we know that they rarely or never
stand in the way of a due resort to rational medical treatment  truly 
the human mind is  in many instances     many sided    

what has just been said will indicate that it is very improbable that
the so called religious literature of early times fairly represents the
state of medical practice  assuredly  one could form no idea of the state
of the healing art at present from the perusal of a manual of orthodox
religious literature 

however  as i have intimated above  the prevalence of an ostensible
belief in the cause and cure of diseases by supernatural powers does not
stand in the way of the existence and practice of a more or less rational
art of healing 

the chaldean      looked to the gods for the removal of the evils which
afflicted him  and he had his set earthly ways by which to bring about
the result desired  supplication  sacrifice  and the like were practiced 
but material means were not entirely neglected  in the sacred book of the
parsis it is said     if several healers offer themselves together  namely 
one who heals with the knife  one who heals with herbs  and one who heals
with the holy word  it is this one who will  best  drive away sickness
from the body of the faithful          in another place the    holy word    is
pronounced    the best healing of all remedies          evidently  one might
resort to other means  if he chose  and here i may remark  that in the
practices of   sculapius there was precisely the same threefold means of
cure  as will be seen by referring to the chapter on the god 

it may be affirmed with confidence that no people in either ancient or
modern times has relied exclusively on the good offices of supernatural
powers for the cure of diseases  according to catlin  the indian doctors
first prescribed    roots and herbs  of which they have a great variety
of species  and when these have all failed  their last resort is to
medicine          a reverse plan was the more common  in that interesting
book     ecclesiasticus     written by one well informed  and even at a time
when medicine was far advanced  the sick man is curiously advised to pray
and sacrifice to god first  and then to give place to the physician      
the old hebrew conveys the idea that  when nothing else could be done 
resort should be had to medical men  he thoughtfully remarks that    there
is a time when thou must fall into their hands         

now  as was to be expected  the grecian god of medicine was viewed by
some through a veil of superstition brought from the east  in connection
with statues of him were things the meaning of which would be entirely
unintelligible without a previous knowledge of ideas entertained in
assyria and other countries  one of these  the special theme of this
chapter  is very interesting because of its historical connections  a
study of it brings to light much exceedingly interesting information 

the pine  or cedar cone  or  as some have spoken of it  the pine apple 
was figured in the hand of the cryselephantine statue of   sculapius  made
by calamis for the temple at sicyon  in arcadia  as in representations
of mardux  what was the meaning of this peculiar object  some have taken
it to have been a phallic symbol  the presence of it on the thyrsus of
dionysus       brought by him from the east  would seem to support that
view  it has also been regarded as a flame      

 illustration  fig        the pine  or cedar cone as seen in the hand of a
winged figure from nimroud  

whether the cedar cone of the sicyonian statue of   sculapius was
representative of the reproductive organ or of fire or not  it is certain
that it was largely in use by the babylonians  assyrians  and others 
to restore health as well as to overcome witchcraft and the like  one
sees it in the hand of the winged  eagle headed figure from nimroud 
now in the british museum  and a cut of the same is given here  two
similar genii or figures  very like the gryphon of greek mythology
connected with apollo  are represented watching  like the cherubim at
the gate of eden  over the priests who attend about the sacred tree of
life    that apple   fig   palm   or somo tree  serpent guarded  which
yields fruit or ambrosia  in which  as de gubernatis says     the life  the
fortune  the glory  the strength  and the riches of the hero have their
beginning          and which is so prominent in the sculptures and records
of oriental peoples  the object is often seen extended under the king   s
nose  apparently that he may inhale the vitalizing emanations from it 
after the manner of the ancients    notion of the mode of reception of the
   breath of life          it even appears on the tree of life in some of
its conventional forms  thus  layard says     the flowers at the end of
the branches are frequently replaced in later assyrian monuments and on
cylinders by the fir  or pine cone  and sometimes by a fruit or ornament
resembling the pomegranate         

in connection with what he has to say about the cones on the tree of
life  george smith expresses the opinion that    the accadians brought the
tradition of the fir cones with them from their original seat in the
colder  mountainous land of media  where the fir      was plentiful    

 illustration  fig        the tree of life  

the use of the fir cone in the cure of disease has been made evident
by recent translations of cuneiform inscriptions       it is said by
lenormant that in a magic fragment as yet inedited the god hea  the
 averruncus par excellence   the vivifier and preserver of the human
race which he has created  prescribes to his son marduk  the mediator  a
mysterious rite which will cure a man whose malady is caused by an attack
of demons     take     says he     to him the fruit of the cedar  and hold it
in front of the sick person  the cedar is the tree which gives the pure
charm and repels the inimical demons  who lay snares         

in the cedar cone  then  in the hand of the figure of   sculapius we have
the symbol and instrument of    the life charm     of which the god hea was
the master and the son the dispenser  and i may add  as lenormant has
suggested  that when fruits of this nature adorn the sacred plant they
characterize it more emphatically than ever as the tree of life 




chapter xiii 

dibbara       a god of pestilence 


there does not appear to be an exception to the rule  that every people
has  to a greater or less extent  referred the causation of epidemic
and other diseases to supernatural powers       in oriental countries
evil spirits were believed to be accountable for it  and  indeed  in the
west  the red indians entertained the same notion  as the reader of mr 
dorman   s interesting book      is well aware  the uncultured mind cannot 
it would seem  grasp the idea that things which the senses cannot readily
perceive may  nevertheless  be entirely natural 

the babylono assyrians  like the american indians  believed in the
existence of innumerable bad as well as good spirits  in fact  to them
every object and force in nature was believed to have a  zi   or spirit 
more or less subject to control       the bad ones  of whom there were
seven emphatically such  delighted in injuring man and afflicting him
with diseases  often taking possession of him  evidently this doctrine 
when fully developed    that is  when the bad spirits were almost or quite
as free to act as the good ones  as among the parsis    afforded a simple
and very satisfactory explanation of the existence of apparent good and
evil in the world  the practice of medicine  based on such views  could 
at best  be little better than mere shamanism 

i may here observe that the chaldeans and others regarded imprecations
as effective in causing diseases  as well as other evils  in a quotation
from a tablet  given by lenormant  it is said    

       the malevolent imprecation acts on man like a wicked demon 
    the voice which curses has power over him         

i need hardly say that a very similar belief is still all but universal 
it appears to be instructive  at any rate  it is practiced enormously 
from the    damn you    of the street urchin to the formal and solemn
   anathema    of the pope of rome  we are familiar with all grades of it 

there has always and everywhere been a tendency to accord great
divinities power to dispense both evil and good  men have made their
chief gods like themselves  anthropomorphic  variable in their feelings
and actions  apollo could cause disease and he could remove it      
of the hebrews    god the same is true  offense at the    sins    of men in
both cases inspires the infliction of pestilential and other diseases 
the numbering of the people by david  although forbidden  leads to the
occurrence of a destructive epidemic       in    ecclesiasticus    it is
explicitly said     he that sinneth in the sight of his maker shall fall
into the hands of the physician         

among those who clothed one evil spirit with imperial power  so to speak 
that spirit has been mainly held accountable for the occurrence of
disease  the iranian  angra mainyu  furnishes an example  and since the
notion of the    devil     our devil  began       he has been often charged
with the offense  thus  we are told in the bible that it was he that
   smote job with sores  from the sole of his foot unto his crown         
still  in this case he was subject to orders  so to speak 

now  it would be strange if  among the evil spirits the exuberant fancy
of uncultured man has called into existence  there were not a leading
one with the special function of causing  at least  pestilential
diseases  such a one is not met with in the mythology of the romans 
greeks  or even the egyptians       but a remarkable one is found in the
accadio sumerian  dibbara  the leader of the plague demons       he was
subject to the orders of ana and hea  in the izdhubar legend of the flood
it is said     let dibbara appear  and let men be mown down    

our knowledge of dibbara  or lubara  is largely of modern date  until
the recent translations of cuneiform inscriptions were made  the records
of him had almost faded out of sight  on his exploits there is an
interesting chapter in george smith   s    chaldean account of genesis         
his history promises to throw considerable light on passages in the bible
and elsewhere  thus  his title of    the darkening one    appears to have
suggested to the psalmist the phrase     the pestilence that walketh in
darkness          he was  probably  the prototype of the destroying    angel   
spoken of in the bible      

dibbara  like many other personifications of evil  partook of the
serpentine form  not unlikely he was originally  to a great degree 
similar to  if not identical with  the fabulous dragon combated by
marduk  this was an embodiment of the chaos of the deep  the principle of
chaos and darkness  he was the serpent of the night  and may have been
primarily the darkness overcome by the sun 




chapter xiv 

hygeia  the goddess of health 


the need of a special divinity to preserve people in a state of health
was widely felt  even in very early times  in egypt  assyria  greece  and
elsewhere  this need found pronounced expression  isis and istar      and
athene were each  in one way or another  accorded great power over bodily
or mental health  but the greeks  in their hygeia  markedly emphasized
and entirely specialized the conception  here we have an exclusively
health divinity  who had more or less of a counterpart in the salus of
the romans    a goddess highly esteemed  worshipped on set days  and to
whom a fine temple was devoted at the eternal city  situated near the
gate called from it porta salutaris 

 illustration  fig        serpent and bowl of hygeia       

from the preceding statements  the reader will observe that the
divinities who were specially interested in the preservation of health
were all females  this is an exceedingly interesting fact  it is not an
incongruous one  either  the ancients were keenly alive to the sense of
fitness in things  and hence it is hardly likely that they made a mistake
in hygeia  the health goddess  from the exercise of the great function of
nurturing and caring for the young of the species  woman has sufficient
claim to the distinction of being   par excellence   the guardian of
health  why the goddess should be a maid rather than a matron is not
extremely clear  likely the idea was to present in her a woman just
mature and free from blemish  in a typically perfect state 

however  we have in hygeia     daughter of p  on  queen of every joy    
to use the appropriate words with which armstrong starts off in the
invocation to her  at the beginning of his fine poem       a very
interesting and beautiful conception  it is easy to understand why this
divinity became very popular  o goddess  if   

                             but for thee 
    nature would sicken  nature soon would die    

as the author just quoted declares  thy worship might well have become
universal  for without health life is burdensome  a gift of doubtful
value  health and long life are things mortals have always craved and
always prized  in that interesting hebr  o chaldean history     tobias    
sara  with her husband  gives utterance to a truly human prayer     have
mercy on us  o lord  have mercy on us  and let us grow old both together
in health             at heart     says dr  brinton     all prayers are for
preservation  the burden of all litanies is a begging for life         

the symbolic representation of the myth of hygeia afforded a fine subject
for the sculptors and other artists  extremely attractive figures of
her were produced  one of them  at least  is doubtless familiar to the
reader  i have reference to the one in which she is represented as a
blooming girl with a serpent twined around her left arm      and feeding
out of a  patera  or chalice held in her right hand  with this ideal
in his mind  the late dr  aitken meigs  in a remarkable address     
delivered in       pronounces    the high born maid    to be    of beauty   s
types  the highest  best idea     and continues    

       nor fragile she  nor pale  but ruddy  strong 
    and gladsome as a tuneful  joyous song 
    her comely form  in swelling curves designed 
    is perfect grace  with glowing strength combined 
    crimson and white in her fair face contend 
    upon her cheeks in sweet confusion blend 
    her rosy lips excel the coral   s brightness 
    brow  nose  and chin are fleecy ways of whiteness 
    loose  flowing  falls her hair  a golden spray 
    forth from her lustrous eyes she scatters day 
       
    in one small hand a cup she deftly holds 
    whilst round her soft  white arm  in many folds
    a serpent twines and from the chalice drinks 
    low crouches sometimes  at her feet  a sphinx 
    from these strange emblems learn her character 
    how very cunning she  and how exact her
    knowledge and profound  how with wondrous skill
    her youth renews  and is discreet and still    

as will be observed  dr  meigs gives an explanation of the symbols
usually connected with figures of hygeia  whom he regarded as to the
physician what the chosen maid was to the knight of old    the patron
saint  the view taken of the serpent is not satisfactory  although better
than that held by cuvier  namely  that it is    to show that temperance
is the source of lengthened life          and if one take the reptile to
be symbolic of the art of healing  why it should be connected with the
goddess of health is not clear  in this connection its presence might
imply that it is only through medicine that health can be preserved 
taking it as symbolic of life  one has little difficulty in understanding
its appropriateness  closely attached to her  and drawing nourishment
from a chalice held in her hand  the meaning might be  that health and
life are intimately related to each other  the former sustaining the
latter  regarding it  however  as simply a  bonus genius  is not out
of the way  the mode of representing it at rome and elsewhere strongly
supports this view  namely  encircling the altar of the goddess  with the
head extending over it       in teutonic mythology     the white lady with
the snake    was associated with medicinal springs 

 illustration  fig        hygeia   as given in murray   s mythology   

according to the mythological record  hygeia      was the daughter of the
god of medicine    sculapius  of her personal history one might almost
say that it is a blank 

numerous representations of hygeia were to be found in greece  and later
in rome  one was usually placed by the side of each of   sculapius 

the worship of hygeia began soon after that of   sculapius and became
wide spread and popular  the romans were quite as devoted in their
attentions to her as the greeks 

i have said sufficient already to indicate that there was no divinity
precisely similar to hygeia in egypt  or any eastern country  some of the
great goddesses were believed to exercise functions akin to hers      
indeed  many of the prominent divinities  from the spouse of hea down 
had accorded to them more or less control over affairs of health and
life  dr  meigs conveys a wrong impression when he says    

       hygeia  daughter of asclepios 
    descended from apollo delios 
    adored as maut      beside the mystic nile 
    with amen ra in theban peristyle         

there is about as much reason to say that athene was hygeia  as that maut
was  or isis  although  as ebers says  she was the divinity    to be called
on to destroy the germs of disease          arguments could be advanced in
favor of the idea that hygeia sprang into existence as a personification
of the great serpent accompanied virgin  river mist  or cloud goddess 
pallas athene  in her capacity of health preserver  the claim in regard
to isis is little or no better  and  in fact  one form of isis  called
neith  or neit  the great mother of the sun god  ra  and the titular
goddess of sais  has always      been believed to correspond closely with
athene  the former was not only usually accompanied by a serpent  like
the latter  but was often represented by one  still  the same might be
said of  perhaps  all the egyptian goddesses 




chapter xv 

medical talismans 


it is well at the start to form a definite conception of what a
talisman means  it is a species of charm  it differs from an amulet 
both are of the character of fetiches  that is  objects in nature  or
of art  believed to possess magical power  if the object be ascribed
consciousness and other mental attributes  it is  properly speaking  an
idol  unlike the amulet  the talisman  to be effective  need not be kept
about the person  but the main characteristic feature of the talisman is
astronomical  or  rather  astrological  it is accorded virtue principally
because made when two planets are in conjunction  or when a star has
reached its culminating point  as one would expect  it has been customary
to have something about the talisman to indicate that it is such  but
many engravings found on them have no astronomical import at all 

the talisman      has a long history  to know when it came into use
one must go back to the time when the study of the stars and their
influence  real or supposed  on mundane affairs began  although it has
been asserted      that adam acquired a knowledge of astrology through
inspiration  it is safe to hold that the accadian      star gazers 
inhabitants of the hills of elam  first gave shape to this  in great
part  pseudo philosophy of nature  which was widely believed in by many
peoples  and still has numerous sincere adherents everywhere  mr  proctor
ventures to declare that    the idea that the stars in their course rule
the fate of men and nations         is a predominant one of the race      
in babylonia  assyria  ph  nicia  egypt  and elsewhere  it received much
attention  indeed  it was part and parcel of the prevailing religions 
most of the oriental systems being largely astronomical in origin  and
the chaldean or  rather  accadian astrologer   s work is obvious enough to
this day       it is seen in the division of time into the week of seven
days  with the seventh one of rest  the sabbath       and the mode of
regulation of religious times and seasons       to say nothing of the
signs of the zodiac  and so on 

it is stated by vitruvius      that astrology      was brought from the
east to greece      by the chaldeans  of whom berosus  the historian 
   the first of them     settled at cos and opened a school there  however
this may be  it is stated in ptolemy   s remarkable book      that medical
astrology originated in egypt 

hippocrates  who lived a century or so before berosus  had certainly a
knowledge of astrology  galen wrote a book on it  and  like hippocrates 
gives special prominence to the influence of the moon  dwelling
particularly on its production of critical changes in diseases  many
another physician thought it necessary to master it       including
chaucer   s    doctor of physick     who was    grounded in astronomie         

from the fact that astrology and religion were closely connected  it
almost necessarily followed that medical talismans possessed more or less
of a religious significance 

among the talismanic gems pictured in de wilde   s book      is one
which has on one side the greek letters         signifying the creator
of the world  or jehovah  and on the other a representation of an
extremely  erotic  and rather misshapen lion rampant  this  worn in a
ring  was said to prevent renal and other diseases  de wilde observes 
in accordance with a belief of ancient date  that in this figure one
has health symbolized  says he      leo erectus verum signum sanitatis
protendit     

what has just been said leads me to remark that the phallus  which was a
common form of the  genius loci   or agathod  mon  was widely believed
to have great power to protect against harm  in it was a sovereign
preventive of malign fascination  or the influence of the evil eye  the
roman god  fascinus       had it as his chief symbol  it is well known
that this charm was sometimes placed on houses      in pompeii  with the
inscription   hic habitat felicitas   aubrey says     in the digging of the
ruins and foundations of london  after the great conflagration  there
were found several little priapusses of copper  about an inch long  w     
the romans did weare about their necks         

 illustration  fig        the divine name   as seen on a talismanic gem 
copied from de wilde   s book   

in regard to the         j      or jao  a variation of jah       the name
of the deity  the demiurge  the sabaoth of the ph  nicians and others 
i may say that it was regarded as possessing in itself irresistible
talismanic power  fort remarks that    as a talisman of medical properties
it was carried about the person in tubes  or  more generally  on
parchment          let me add that the tetragrammaton   that is  j h v h 
or  as it is commonly rendered  jehovah   was the same thing as the        
much could be said about it  as those familiar with masonic legends and
occult literature are aware  lenormant states  of the wide belief in the
power of the hidden    name of the lord     that    we now see clearly that it
came from chaldea          elsewhere  reference is made to the potent word
which hea bore in his heart 

in this connection i may say a word on the    triliteral monosyllable    of
the brahmin and buddhist  aum  to which still  as in the past  great
potency is attached  being a symbol of the supreme  it is characterized
as    that which passes not away     dr  birdwood remarks that it is    the
identical formula of every hindu god  the letter a is the  vija mantra 
of the male buddha  the generative power  u  the ditto of the female
 dharma   law   the type of productive power  and m  the  sanga 
 congregation  or union of the essences of both         

 illustration  fig        forms of the prescription symbol  

the symbol placed at the head of medical prescriptions  and which is
usually believed to stand for  recipe   may be regarded as a sort of
obsolete talisman  the original form of it appears to have been a figure
like a z  with the lower horizontal part crossed with a sceptre shaped
line  this  or a modification of it  has been from time immemorial the
symbol of the planet jupiter  hence the reason  it has been asserted 
for placing it at the head of prescriptions  for the great planet  the
bearer of the name of the father of life  was believed in other days to
have a favorable influence over diseases  and here i may observe that in
another chapter i have spoken of the interesting fact that marduk     
of the babylono assyrians stood for jupiter  and that in him was
assimilated the benignant mediator and healer of the accadio sumerians 
silik mulu khi 

the symbol is generally described as being simply the initial letter
of zeus  the greek name of jupiter  but this leaves part of it out of
account  a part which might be taken to be a sceptre  an object which 
accompanied by a serpent  as the symbol of life  was prominent in
representations of jupiter  but one might with some reason regard it as
made up of the initial and terminal letters of zadykiel  or zadakiel 
the angel and the spirit of the great planet  according to astrologers
and others  and again  by taking it to be composed of an r and an l  one
might hold it to be derived from the name of raphael  the angel of the
sun  but  as already stated  it is probable that the body of the original
figure was not an r  i may add that mr  taylor says that this ideogram
   resolves itself into an arm grasping a thunderbolt    

if the prescription mark be a thing of astrological origin  it is a
remnant of an extensive body of facts and theories  long highly prized 
shakspere makes  king lear   in an interesting passage  characterize
the reference of man   s destiny    to the sun  the moon  and the stars    
as    the excellent foppery of the world          but no doubt innumerable
hosts of believers in the system were thoroughly sincere  from the days
when the accadians became distinguished for their observations of the
heavens  down to very recent times  medical astrology occupied a position
in popular thought and esteem which almost exceeds the power of credence
of the modern scientific physician  not only in administering medicines 
but in gathering medicinal herbs  the position of the planets had to be
considered  for it was believed that the herbs got their virtues from
them  without the benign influence of the    host of heaven     no good could
be expected from the physician  or his remedies 

the belief in the power of the different constellations of the zodiac
over special parts of the body and their diseases is still indicated by
the curious figure often seen in almanacs 

abraxas stones are largely medical in character   medical talismans      
much might be said of them  fort remarks     these gems  endowed with
omnipotent curative and talismanic power  quickly acquired a celebrity
undiminished for ages  and whose possible interpretation even yet
attracts erudite attention         

each of these remarkable objects consisted of a piece of glass  paste 
or other mineral substance  occasionally a metallic one  on which was
usually some figure  often a serpent  or inscription  together with the
word    abraxas     which constituted their distinctive feature 

the greek letters of the mystical word     abraxas     equaled in numerical
value           the number of days in the year  after speaking of the
serpent of evil on one  sharpe says     underneath it is written the
magical word abrasa   hurt me not   an egyptian word  which the greeks
made use of  as believing that the evil spirits were better acquainted
with the egyptian language than with the greek          not a few  however 
believe that the word is not such at all 

 illustration  fig        abraxas stone   from de wilde   

the abraxas stones are believed to have originated with the basilidian
gnostics  a sect which basilides  a syrian by birth  who lived under
trajan and his successor  in the latter half of the first century  was
instrumental in originating  whether they were intended at first to be
simply a means of recognition is an undecided question  those given to
magic adopted them largely  the opinion has been expressed that doubtless
the greater part of the stones were made in the middle ages      




chapter xvi 

medical amulets 


any object believed to be possessed of a mysterious power of warding off
or removing evil of any kind may be regarded as an amulet  a medical
amulet is one capable of warding off or of removing a disease or
diseases  the prevention of disease  or  what is much the same thing  the
preservation of health  is the use to which it has been chiefly put  this
is quite as true of its use to day as formerly 

in speaking of medical amulets one has no reason to use only the past
tense  they are still much used  as the reader of brande  or of the
publications of the folk lore society  or of  notes and queries   well
knows  nor are the patrons of them of the illiterate class only  every
physician has  doubtless  met with instances of their use by persons of
intelligence  here is a clergyman who carries a chestnut in his pocket to
keep off rheumatism  and there is an attorney at law who keeps a stolen
potato about him for the same purpose  in ancient times  however  their
use was extremely common  all but universal 

of the practical value of amulets i may say  without hesitancy  that it
is very great  of course it would be irrational to hold that they act  to
any extent  otherwise than through impressions made by them on the mind 
such impressions may undoubtedly be powerful for good  that this is the
case few competent to form an opinion on the subject will question  the
intelligent reader of history  as well as the scientific psychologist
and physician  has abundant reason to know that it is true  i repeat what
i have deliberately said elsewhere     amulets do serve  in a measure  to
prevent disease  anything which inspires confidence and hope is sanative
in its effects  faith is a powerful healer         

a gem with a symbol of one kind or another engraved on it was  from an
early period  an ordinary medical amulet  a common symbol was a figure of
hygeia  and one of serapis was long quite as common  the name of raphael
 literally healer of god   the patron angel of the early christians  was
often shown on both amulets and talismans  this angel had a reputation
as a healer       as the reader familiar with    tobias    is aware  in that
historical book  it is said that when tobias and sara were afflicted    the
holy angel of the lord  raphael  was sent to heal them both          tobias
was told by him that if he put a little piece of a fish   s heart upon
coals the smoke thereof would drive away all kinds of devils  either from
man or woman  and that they would not return      

a serpent was a very familiar object on gems used as amulets  the later
egyptians  who were great believers in such things  were very partial
to it  among the objects found by general di cesnola  in cypress  was
a scarab  oid of banded agate  on which are engraved two asps with a
cartouche between  inscribed with the word           in reference to this
word he says     it can be no other than           the old form of               and
may possibly be a proper name after the analogy of draco  not uncommon
in greece  and echidna  whose amour with hercules herodotus relates  or 
if taken in its primary sense the word may constitute an amulet against
the asps  still so plentiful in cyprus  and to be of the nature of those
prophylactic rings against snake bites alluded to by aristophanes      
arab amulets  at the present day  bear the figure of the thing against
which they exert their virtue  and all oriental practices in this line
come down from immemorial antiquity         

i may remark that the use of images of things feared to save from them
has  indeed  been extensively practiced  the cause and the effect  in
many afflictions  might be so used  the golden emerods and mice  spoken
of in the bible  are instances       the same idea may have had something
to do with the use of the brazen serpent of moses  the chaldeans  in
resorting to this peculiar plan of dealing with their evil spirits 
represented them  says lenormant     under such hideous forms that they
believed that it was sufficient for them to be shown their own image to
cause them to flee away alarmed          and this leads me to say that
great medical virtues have been held to spring from things repulsive 
thus  water drank from the skull of a suicide has received credit for the
cure of many a case of epilepsy  tasting the blood of a murderer has been
resorted to successfully in cases of the same disease 

a word in this connection about adder stones may not be amiss  these
objects have long been regarded by many as charms or amulets of great
power  they are simply the whorls or rude fly wheels put on spindles
of spinning wheels  dr  a  mitchell discusses them at length in his
interesting arch  ological work      

under the head of medical amulets are to be classed many things  such
as blessed objects and relics of various kinds  the extent to which
these were used  century after century  down even to our own day  is
surprising  the interested reader may advantageously turn to fort   s
learned work       the sprinkling of    holy water         over patients by
pious catholics is familiar to every physician  i have seen a few drops
of water from lourdes given by a priest to his mother  sinking from
lung disease  a few weeks ago i saw a cup of water in which a little
earth from knock  in the south of ireland  was mixed  given with great
confidence in its power for good  in a case of difficult labor  in the
   zend avesta    wonderful virtue is ascribed to  gomez        and the same
thing is equally lauded in the sacred books of the hindus  what strange
beliefs mortals may have 

certain numerals have had remarkable properties accorded them by
philosophical and other speculators  seven has occupied a prominent
position  the primitive chaldeans  in their study of the heavens  became
acquainted with seven planets  including the sun and moon  and their week
consisted of seven days  with the egyptians and others the same was the
case  pythagoras saw in this number the three of the triangle and the
four of the square    the two perfect figures  it was considered sacred
to helios and also apollo  the hebrew  sheba  means seven  and was the
symbol of a deity      before it came to signify an oath  as a charm or
amulet  the number was believed to be possessed of great potency  health
was assured by carrying it about the person on a gem or the like  ebers
illustrates this superstition in one of his splendid historical novels 
he makes boges  in giving a ring to cr  sus  speak thus    

   take this ring  it has never left my finger since i quitted egypt 
and it has a significance far beyond its outward worth  pythagoras 
the noblest of the greeks  gave it to my mother when he was tarrying
in egypt to learn the wisdom of our priests  and it was her parting
gift to me  the number seven is engraved upon the simple stone  this
indivisible number represents perfect health  both to soul and body 
for health is likewise one and indivisible  the sickness of one member
is the sickness of all  one evil thought allowed to take up its abode
within our heart destroys the entire harmony of the soul  when you see
this seven  therefore  let it recall my heart   s wish that you may ever
enjoy undisturbed bodily health and long retain that loving gentleness
which has made you the most virtuous and  therefore  the healthiest of
men         

as already intimated  the chaldeans attributed special virtues to
certain numbers  of which seven would seem to have been the most highly
esteemed  unfortunately  none of their numerical formul   have as yet
been discovered  the    mamit    or    number    has been referred to before 
lenormant remarks     more powerful than the incantations were conjurations
wrought by the power of numbers  in this way the supreme secret which
hea taught to his son  silik mulu khi  when he consulted him in his
distress  was always called    the number            

a remnant of the old belief in the relation of seven to health is the
wide spread superstitious notion that the seventh son of the seventh son
is possessed of special healing powers  curiously enough  i had a visit
from such a person  just before writing this  and he as firmly believes
that he can cure    the evil    and other ills with certainty as any king
that ever exercised the royal gift 

the color red has long served the purpose of an amulet  to this day a red
string is occasionally seen around the necks of children to protect them
against scarlet fever and other pestilential diseases  and the belief
in the special virtue of red flannel is almost universal  says aubrey 
   johannes medicus  who lived and wrote in the time of edward ii  and was
physition to that king  gives an account of his curing the prince of ye
small pox  a disease but then lately known in england  by ordering his
bed  his room  and his attendants to be all in scarlet  and imputes ye
cure in great measure to the virtue of ye colour          the same was done
in the case of the emperor francis i  in      

of red it is certainly true that it is a warm color  and the impression
of it on the mind is stimulating  experiments have shown that different
colors exert various influences over living forms  including man 

but  although medical virtues have been ascribed to red  it has been
looked on as anything but good  says ebers     in the    papyrus ebers    all
injurious and evil things are called red          the scorching sands of
the desert  likely  gave the egyptian his dislike to the color  in the
hindu book of the law       a man is forbidden to marry a girl with
reddish hair  but why is not stated  satan is usually given a suit of
fiery hue 

the ankh was a symbol of the egyptians signifying life  it received the
latin name of  crux ansata   or handled cross  from its shape  sometimes
it is spoken of as the key of life  each of the great divinities carries
one     we do not know     says kenrick     the reason why life was represented
by the  crux ansata           it seems  however  that the object was at
first simply a crossed pole  used to measure the degree of rise in the
waters of the nile during the period of flood  an annual occurrence of
vital importance to the inhabitants of the historic region  from this
originated  according to pluche and others  the meaning of life attached
to it  in the hand of thoth  a serpent was sometimes twined around it 
from it has sprung  according to gerald massey  many modern symbols and
words     it is extant     says he     in the great seals of england  in a
reversed position  as the token of power and authority          and he
ventures to affirm that    to be anxious is to be very much alive

regarded as a tau or t      with a link attached  it was often
interpreted as typhon chained  as such it was customary to suspend it
as an amulet from the necks of children and sick people  and it was
connected with the wrappings of mummies  m  pluche  who has gone at
length into this interesting subject  says     this custom of bridling the
powers of the enemy  and of hanging a captive typhon about the necks of
children  of sick persons  and of the dead  appeared so beneficial and
so important that it was adopted by other nations  the children and the
sick most commonly wore a ticket  whereon was a t  which they looked
upon as a powerful preventive  in process of time  other characters were
substituted in the room of the letter t  which was at first engraved
on this ticket  but of which the other nations understood neither the
meaning nor intention  they often put a serpent on it  an harpocrates  or
the object of the devotions in vogue  nay  sometimes ridiculous figures 
or even some that were of the utmost indecency  but the name of  amulet 
that was given to the ticket  and which signifies the removal of evil 
most naturally represents the intention of the egyptians  from whom this
practice came         

 illustration  fig        health  in hieroglyphics  

a sceptre  tem   which  alone  may signify strong  in connection with the
ankh stands for strong life  or health  this combination is seen on one
of the faces of the obelisk now in london 

touch pieces  or golden eagles  were special coins first issued by king
henry vii to persons    touched for the evil     one side of the piece bore
an angel standing on a dragon  with the inscription   soli deo gloria  
and the other a ship in full sail  some had other designs  a hand
extending from above was often given    an old symbol of healing  being
in use in egypt  and generally having in connection with it a serpent 
or a figure of serapis       the hand of the lord so frequently spoken
of in the bible may have suggested it  specimens of those issued by
charles ii and james ii are to be seen in the collection of coins now
in the pennsylvania museum and school of industrial art  memorial hall 
fairmount park  philadelphia  there are cuts of several in pettigrew   s
work      

the touch pieces were carefully preserved and used as amulets 

the practice of touching for the evil by english sovereigns  from
edward the conqueror down to queen anne  did not originate with them 
tacitus      gives an interesting account of the cure of a case of
blindness and of one of paralysis  in the same way  by vespasian  every
bible reader knows that it was resorted to in palestine  but it was in
vogue in greece three centuries before our era  in his    life of pyrrhus    
plutarch says     it was believed that he cured the swelling of the spleen
by sacrificing a white cock  and with his right foot gently pressing the
part affected  the patients lying upon their backs for the purpose  there
was no person  however poor or mean  to whom this relief  if requested 
was refused  he received no reward except the cock for sacrifice  and
this present was very agreeable to him    

 illustration  fig        a medicine bag  

the medicine bag of the north american indians has been almost
universally regarded by that race as of wonderful virtue in warding off
harmful influences of all kinds  it has served them as a preventive  and
also  like prince ahmed   s apple  as a cure for every disease  catlin says
he found that    every  male  indian  in his primitive state  carries his
medicine bag in some form or other  to which he pays the greatest homage
and to which he looks for safety and protection through life         
the same writer  who  i may remark  had a very wide acquaintance
among indians  pronounces it to be    the key to indian life and indian
character         

the contents of this mysterious bag  this    bag of wonders     are preserved
a secret  one which none wishes to discover  these consist of a medicinal
herb  or the like  with some packing material  such as dried grass or
moss 

the medicine bag is formed from the skin of a human being or some
reptile  bird  or other creature  the suggestion of the substance to be
used was left to a dream  inspired by the    great spirit     and experienced
during the fast indulged in about puberty  the time when the indian
   makes his medicine     that is  learns what animal is to be his guardian 
as it were  various ornaments are attached to it 

the medicine bag is attached to the belt or carried in the hand  no other
possession could be compared with it in value  and money could not buy
one  it is buried with its owner 

as already hinted  the medicine bag is not considered of medical import
only  it is believed to have a power over all injurious influences  by
   medicine    the indian has reference to everything he cannot understand 
catlin and others are doubtless right in their opinion that it came from
the french word for doctor   m  decin   it is the  manito  or  manitou 
of the algonkin  the  oki  of the iroquois  and the  teotl  of the aztec 
and  curious to observe  these words also mean serpent 

i may also explain here that the    medicine man    is not alone the
physician  he deals with the mysterious generally  there were three
kinds  the jossakeeds  or seers or prophets  the medas  or medical
practitioners  and the wabenos  a class that indulged in night orgies 

in miss emerson   s book it is said that    the dress of the medas of the
celebrated mandan indians  whose tribe is now extinct  was a medley of
the animal and vegetable kingdom  all anomalies in nature were used as
of great medical effect in the construction of this professional guard 
the skin of the yellow bear usually formed the most important feature of
the dress  and to this was sometimes attached the skins of snakes and
the hoofs of deer  goats  and antelopes          the appearance of such a
   doctor    was surely sufficient to frighten away most of the evil spirits
which were the source of human ills

pharmacists    symbols 


the art of the pharmacist is old  it is assuredly of prehistoric origin 
the reader of dioscorides or of pliny is astonished at the number of
herbs and other things used as medicines and the complexness of many
popular prescriptions  referring to the pharmacist  it is curiously
observed  in    ecclesiasticus     that    of his works there shall be no
end          in other days than ours there was evidently a morbid taste for
the multiplication of remedies of doubtful worth    a deplorable infirmity
of many physicians 

it is stated by ebers  in his    egyptian princess     that each of the
egyptian temples had its laboratory and apothecary  there is a list of
two hundred drugs which were kept in the temple of edfu  but just when
the preparation and sale of medicines became a special business cannot
be stated  in early times it was customary for the physician to compound
his own prescriptions  as is done in rural places yet  mr  fort remarks
that    toward the conclusion of the third century the first indications
present themselves of the existence of a class of  roman  citizens to
whose vigilant care was confided the preparation of medicaments ordered
by attendant physicians          the same writer says     the storage of
medicinal supplies seems to have approximated the pharmacy in the twelfth
century  although even earlier the word  apothecary  appears to have
been interchangeable with the booth where assorted wares were offered at
public sale          at the end of the twelfth century the bishop of london
was named  apothecarius   or pharmacist  to king henry    a fact which
proves that the art of bolus was then  at least  highly esteemed 

now  although the establishment of the pharmacist has mysteries in
abundance connected with it  the special symbols pertaining to the
business are but few  the chief and most characteristic one is the mortar
and pestle  in larwood and hotten   s interesting book it is said     one
of the signs originally used exclusively by apothecaries was the mortar
and pestle  their well known implements for pounding drugs          in an
attractive form and generally gilded  it is to be seen at nearly all
pharmacies in this country  only occasionally is it pictured  i know an
instance in philadelphia where cupid is represented in connection with
it  but this is as absurd an addition as the negro youth who is using the
pestle in another  an eagle   the national bird   is sometimes represented
hovering over it  the pestle used for grinding corn was deified by the
romans under the name of pilumnus  in connection with the mortar it is
highly spoken of in the sacred books of the hindus 

 illustration  fig        mortar and pestle  

the skull and cross bones has come to be of pharmaceutical significance 
placed on the label of a vial  it implies that the contents are
poisonous  and should be used with intelligence and care  it has been
in use from an early date as an emblem of death  formerly  it was often
placed on tombstones 

bottles or vases  colored or containing colored liquids  are of
pharmaceutic import  the question of the origin of their use as signs is
often asked  it cannot be definitely answered  but  as to how the custom
originated one may confidently say that it arose from the common sense
desire of the dealer in medicinal wares to make the fact obvious to the
passer by  the confectioner does essentially the same thing  and so 
indeed  do the grocer and many others 

by turning to larwood and hotten   s book it will be seen that a golden
bottle has been used as a banker   s and a goldsmith   s sign  also  that
bottles of various kinds have in other days  as now  decorated many a
tavern front 

hence  a bottle or vase can hardly be regarded as a symbol  and much less
the exclusive symbol of a dealer in medicines  if it were similar in
every instance  and had something special in its form or color  or both 
it might be so regarded 

as it is  one cannot very well regard it in any other light than as a
part of the dealer   s ordinary stock  still  it must be said that there
is something decidedly distinct and special about it  as seen in the
pharmacist   s window 

in this country  at least  the shape of the vase or vases  for there are
generally three or four  and their color are not subject to any rule 
and  in fact  there are a few stores in philadelphia in which there are
none  the favorite colors seem to be light green  claret  light blue  and
amber 

it is very probable that the presence of special colored liquids in
show bottles does not date back much farther than  if as far as 
        the time when the apothecaries became a distinct class from
grocers  in england  certainly  some of the beautiful shades of color
are very modern 

exhibiting bottles containing actual medicines is doubtless a much more
ancient practice than that of exhibiting them for the sake of their own
showiness or that of the solutions placed therein  that has  in all
probability  been customary from the time when dealing in drugs began 
when was that 

it is known that the art of the pharmacist and trading in drugs were
practiced at an early period in egypt  thus  in the    papyrus ebers    
which was written      years before our era  we learn that for most
diseases remedies were prescribed  drawn from all three kingdoms of
nature  and in some instances were brought from distant lands  the
prescriptions  i may add  were compounded according to exact weights and
measures  two recipes for pills are given  one with honey for women  and
one without it for men  one for the preparation of a hair dye  ascribed
to the mother in law      of the first king of egypt is given  which
ebers states      to be the earliest of all recipes preserved to us  the
date of its origin being about      b c 

i could give many egyptian and other ancient references to fancy vessels
of glass and other materials used in the pursuit of ministering to the
sick  one extremely interesting direct reference to the use of medicinal
vases at a very early date has recently been brought to the attention of
the public  i refer to a translation of an assyrian fragment made by mr 
j  halevy  given in    the records of the past          it is so interesting
from several points of view that i will give it here in its entirety    

       for the eruptions and humors which afflict the body 
    fill a vase which has held drugs with water from an inexhaustible
        well 
    put in it a shoot of     a     reed  some date sugar  some urine 
        some bitter hydromel
    add to it some     
    saturate it with pure water  and 
    pour upon it the water of the  sick  man 
    cut reeds in an elevated meadow 
    beat some pure date sugar with some pure honey 
    add some sweet oil which comes from the mountain 
    mix them together 
    rub  with this ointment  the body of the  sick man     

the reference to the    art of the apothecary    made in the bible      has
been regarded as    the first recorded notice upon the subject of medicine
and pharmacy       as  for example  by the late professor  dr  george b 
wood       but here we have explicit evidence that farther back  say
     years before the time of moses  people were in the habit of having
medicines stored in vases of a set kind  and that the babylonians had
considerable pharmaceutical knowledge  as well as that their medical
practice was not exclusively magical  or  as mr  halevy puts it     it
proves that the babylonians were in the possession of a rational medicine
as well as a magical one          he further remarks that it is    the only
known specimen of an assyro babylonian prescription    




chapter xviii 

miscellaneous medical symbols 


the barber   s and surgeon   s pole    the peculiar pole made use of by barbers
as a sign seems to have been medical in origin  for a long time the
barber performed all the duties of the surgeon  it was in the year     
that  on petition  king edward iv granted    the freemen of the mystery of
barbers of the city of london  using the mystery or faculty of surgery    
   the mystery     which constituted the beginning of the present royal
college of surgeons of england       it was not  however  until the
middle of the eighteenth century        that each began to limit his
functions 

the sign is generally explained thus  the pole represents a stick 
usually held in his hand by the patient while getting bled  and the
red and white spiral stripes  blood and a bandage  respectively  the
colors  it may be observed  are not always arranged in spiral parallel
stripes  nor are the colors limited to red and white  the use of blue
with  or even without  red is partly allowable  on account of venous
blood being somewhat bluish in hue  mr  jeaffreson  indeed  says that
   the chirurgical pole  properly tricked out  ought to have a line of blue
paint  another of red  and a third of white          spirally arranged 

on the top of the pole there is usually placed  in great britain  france 
and other european countries  a brass basin  with a semicircular gap in
one side  this vessel is used by the barber to keep the clothes of his
patrons from being soiled  with a gallipot  instead of the basin  one
has the real pole of the surgeon  which has been extensively used as a
sign  without either  it is in use by the barbers in this country  lord
thurlow  a member of the house of commons  delivered a speech on the   th
of july        in opposition to the surgeons    incorporation bill  in
which he said     by a statute  still in force  the barbers and surgeons
were each to use a pole  the barbers were to have theirs blue and white
striped  with no appendage  but the surgeons     which was the same in
other respects  was likewise to have a gallipot and a red flag  to denote
the particular nature of their vocation    

the color yellow    it is a well known fact that yellow is a
characteristically medical color  a flag of this color is in use at
lazarettos  and it is often placed at plague stricken spots  as a warning
to the observer to keep away  how is the medical import of the color to
be accounted for  in christian symbolism it signifies faith  but one
must turn  i believe  to astrology to learn the reason of its medical
significance  to the astrologer  yellow was the color of the sun  and
it was to this planet  anciently so regarded  that the possession of
greatest influence over disease was accorded 

the physician   s conveyance    it is said that asclepiades  the ancient
quack  perambulated the world on a cow   s back  living on her milk as
he went along  we have no reason to believe that such a mode of moving
from point to point ever became a professional custom  but physicians in
recent times have always had  in most places  characteristic methods of
travel  in their rounds among their patients 

it appears that  previous to the reign of charles ii  it was customary
for the english doctors to visit on horseback     sitting     as jeaffreson
says     sideways on foot cloths  like women          at any rate  aubrey
says that harvey    rode on horseback with a foot cloth  his men following
on foot  as the fashion then was  which was very decent  now quite
discontinued          later  carriages of various kinds  some very showy 
came into vogue 

for many years the physicians of philadelphia  as of other prominent
american cities  have been known  as they have gone about their duties 
by their use of a special form of phaeton  it is a four wheeled
conveyance  with a fixed top  and is drawn by one horse  riding in it
is pleasant  and its generous top protects well in bad weather  several
years ago a two wheeled modification of it was introduced  but it did not
become popular  and of late has been disappearing  by a few of the more
well to do in the profession  two horse carriages of various styles are
used  but there is nothing characteristic about them 

the physician   s gold headed cane    much might be written about the
gold headed cane of the physician  although it has had its day  it
was long considered an important part of a medical outfit  jeaffreson
ventures to affirm that formerly    no doctor would have presumed to pay
a professional visit  or even to be seen in public  without this mystic
wand          what was its history  did it come down to our time as a
representative of the one placed in the hand of the god of medicine
by the artists  jeaffreson expresses the opinion that it is    a relic
of the conjuring paraphernalia with which the healer in ignorant and
superstitious times always worked upon the imagination of the credulous    
and that    it descended to him from hermes and mercurius        it was a
relic     he adds     of old jugglery  and of yet older religion         
as the reader is aware  these statements are open to criticism  but 
whatever its origin may have been  it was almost universally used by
physicians until recently 

the physician   s cane was generally smooth  of moderate weight  and with
a gold head in the form of a knob  a gold head  what was the meaning
of that  was it used because of the bearer   s reputed love of the
precious metal  chaucer says  and with charming casuistry  in the famous
description of his doctor    

       for gould in physike is a cordial 
    therefore  he lovede gould in special         

it may  then  have been its medicinal virtues  virtues still occasionally
lauded by therapeutic prospectors  which suggested the use of it in the
cane  but  after all  the desire to make a good appearance may have been
the reason for its use 

the head of the cane was not always solid  on the contrary  it was often 
like many a one   s  doubtless  who carried it  hollow  in the cavity  it
was customary to keep something medicinal  such as ammonia  about this
there was much mystery in the minds of the populace  jeaffreson  who may
very properly be regarded as of this class  says that the doctor    always
held it to his nose  when he approached a sick person  so that its fumes
might protect him from the noxious exhalations of his patient         
something of the kind is still supposed by many to be done  the idea
was entertained by more than a few  that within the head of the cane
existed  in some cases at least  a familiar spirit which gave the owner
extraordinary power  paracelsus was reputed to have within the pummel of
his long sword  which he used instead of a cane  a genius  in the form of
a bird  which enabled him to perform wonders  butler speaks of it thus    

       bombastus kept a devil   s bird 
    shut up in the pummel of his sword 
    that taught him all the cunning pranks
    of past and future mountebanks         

alchemists said that it was the philosopher   s stone  but it has been with
better reason conjectured      that it was laudanum    an agent which the
bold  talented quack was in the habit of using much with striking results 

there is preserved  in the college of physicians of london  a cane which
was carried successively by drs  radcliffe  mead  askew  pitcairn  and
baillie  on it are coats of arms used by the distinguished carriers of
it  the gold head of it is in the form of a crooked cross bar  and not a
knob    the orthodox one  a book has been written with it for the title 
treating of its several owners      

the physician   s dress    at the present time there is nothing about the
dress of the physician symbolic of his calling  formerly the case was
different  until less than a century ago  the dress of the members of the
medical profession was both decidedly typical and remarkable  it was worn
last  it is said  by dr  henry revell reynolds  one of the physicians
of george iii  the items of it were  a well powdered three tailed wig 
a silk coat  breeches  stockings  buckled shoes  and lace ruffles  says
jeaffreson     next to his cane  the physician   s wig was the most important
of his accoutrements  it gave profound learning and wise thought to lads
just out of their teens          if this were the case it should be coaxed
into use again 

the physician   s ring    among the ancients  rings were held in high
esteem  the signet of solomon  which had considerable to do with the
building of the great temple  and the ring of gyges  the shepherd of the
king of lydia  through which he could become invisible and see people
at pleasure  are examples of the surprising powers often accorded to
them  one was  until a period not far distant  an important item of the
insignia of the medical man  it is spoken of in one of the spurious
hippocratic works  the seal variety was the orthodox one  different
stones were used  and on these were engraved various designs  as
indicative of his position  a learned writer says that the doctor wore
the ring    on the third finger of the right hand         

the physician   s ring was viewed generally in the light of an amulet 
or talisman  the engraving it bore had much to do with its supposed
virtues  and the stone also gave it special value  aubrey thus refers to
a sapphire ring     they say it preserves from infection and pestilential
diseases  see albertus magnus  de hoc   i warrant he has recited virtues
enough of it          red carnelian was believed to be curative of
h  morrhage  and coral of nervous affections 




chapter xix 

medical symbolism in practice 


it is hardly necessary to say to the reader who has followed me this far
that the scope of medical symbolism is not very restricted  in extent
it is obviously not limited  nor is it without variety and the means of
variety enough  yet how little use does one see made of it  how seldom
do publishers take any advantage whatever of it  on the covers of their
books or anywhere else  and what little is here and there attempted is
apt to be a trifle preposterous  on a par with the misuse of the serpent
by the quack medicine man  who confounds the most obvious religious
 christian  significance of it with the medical 

examples without limit of questionable medical symbols might be given 
here is a publisher who makes use of the caduceus of hermes  there is one
who displays the club of hercules  with a rather venomous looking serpent
crawling down it from aloft  and yonder one who exhibits a skull on a
closed book  suggestive of a hopeless meditation on death    the reverse of
what the physician should indulge in  but  at a time when the absence of
symbols is almost the rule  perhaps one should try to be a little blind
to the faults of those which are met with 

of a collection of medical symbols on hand  few are notably good  i may
instance a fair specimen  on the title page of a journal edited by the
late dr  dunglison  a learned and sensible man   the american medical
intelligencer   which had a brief existence in the latter half of the
fourth decade of this century  appears the figure a copy of which is here
given  fig       the idea is better than its execution 

ideas for symbolic designs of medical import are not scarce  the
instruments and drugs used by the disciples of   sculapius afford a host 
if one does not wish to turn to mythology or anything allied  but 
although the scientific physician might properly hesitate about using 
say  an emblem of st  luke  the patron saint of physicians  there are
mythological and related conceptions  many of which might be utilized to
good purpose  thus  if it be desired to give an egyptian design on the
cover of a book  say  on obstetrics  the main part of an admirable one
may be found ready at hand on the wall of the great temple at luxor      
it is the scene   and a sufficiently chaste one  too   of the maiden mother
giving birth to the future king  amunotoph iii  for whom the temple or
palace was erected about      b c  she is seated on the midwife   s stool 
as described in the bible       while two nurses have her by the hands 
doing what they can to ease the pains of labor  or  a representation
of pasht  bubastis  or sekhet  the sister of horus and mother of
imhotep    who generally appeared cat headed because the cat  a most sacred
animal  was consecrated to her    would not be inappropriate  for  to use
the words of ebers     she seems to have been honored as the deity who
conferred the blessing of children and watched over their birth         

 illustration  fig        a medical symbol  

but  for a design of obstetrical import  there could probably be few
better than one in which prominence were given to the good housewifery
symbols    the pestle  hatchet  and broom  those  respectively  of
pilumnus  a god of children  intercidona  the goddess who first taught
the art of cutting firewood  and deverra  the goddess who invented the
broom  that great instrument of cleanness and enemy of the typhon  or 
i may say  hydra  of many modern doctors    the disease germ  the deities
that saved the pregnant woman from harm from her special enemies  the
unclean sylvan gods  the broom  wise old romans  wiser than the unsteady
enthusiasts of our time  with bottles of carbolic acid in their hands
yesterday and of corrosive sublimate to day  and with these symbols 
especially if the design were for a work by a female author  there might
be given a figure of juno lucina  the special friend of women in labor 
the type of the eileithyiai  the handmaids of hera  of the greeks 

and here i may observe that  according to ancient custom  the goddess
juno lucina should be represented with one hand empty and  as it were 
ready to receive the coming infant  and with the other holding a lighted
torch  a symbol of life  the torch should be erect  for when the flame
is turned downward it signifies death  in the seal of the american
gyn  cological society  a woman  possibly meant for juno  is represented
with a torch in her right hand and in the other a sprig of evergreen 
with a baby resting on the arm  this is of obstetric import  the members
of the society  however  consider themselves something else than
midwives  judging from their title  they might be  petits ma  tres  




chapter xx 

the pentacle 


by way of conclusion  and at the risk of running too deep into occult
learning  i will give some account of a remarkable magic figure  of
interest to the physician  about which little appears to be generally
known  but which is often referred to in certain out of the way lines
of study  i refer to the pentacle  or triple triangle  the pentalpha
of pythagoras  the formulator of a celebrated system of philosophy 
the basal idea of which is that all things sprang from numbers  a
representation of it in its simple form is given herewith  on inspection 
it will be observed that the figure has five arms  or points  five
double triangles  with five acute angles within and five obtuse ones
without  so that  if five   a number made up of the first even     and
the first      odd one       be possessed of the virtue which the occult
philosophers have asserted  the pentacle must have much  it is  in fact 
the famous legendary key of solomon  which has played a remarkable r  le
in history  tennyson  one of the few well known authors by whom reference
to it is made  speaks of it when he makes one of his characters  katie 
thoughtlessly draw  it can be done through one stroke    

       with her slender pointed foot 
    some figure like a wizard   s pentagram 
    on garden gravel         

 illustration  fig        the pentacle  

i have said that little is generally known about the pentacle  here
is some evidence  ruskin defines it to be    a five pointed star  or
a double triangle ornament  the symbol of the trinity           a wrong
definition  but not quite as bad as that given in mollett   s handsome
work  to wit     a figure formed of two triangles  intersected so as to
form a six pointed star          the opinion is expressed by bayard taylor
that the magical powers attributed to it could be explained by the fact
that  being made up of three triangles  it was a    triple symbol of the
trinity          this may be true  but it was regarded as possessing
mysterious powers long before christianity originated 

a common mistake   the one evidently made by mollett   of even learned
writers  as  for example  oliver      and fairholt       is to confound
the pentacle with the seal of solomon  called also the shield of david  
which consists of two equilateral triangles so arranged as to form a
six pointed star 

by the german writers on magic and kindred subjects  the pentacle
is often called  drudenfuss     that is  wizard   s foot    a term which
mackey      takes to be a corruption of the word for druid   s foot  by
which people it was in use  being often worn  as a symbol of deity 
on their sandals  as bayard taylor  however  says      drud   from the
same root as druid  was the old german word for wizard     in mr  blake   s
interesting book       a representation of a very old coin is given  on
which the mystic figure appears 

the pentacle has been observed on a figure of anubis  in egypt  it
is stated      that it was used on coins of antiochus epiphanes  and
also      of lysimachus  i have seen it stated somewhere that it is one
of the old sect marks of the hindus  but this is an error  i believe  by
referring to coleman   s      or birdwood   s      work  it will be found
that it is solomon   s seal which has been so used  it was one of the
totems of the american indians  dawson      gives a picture of it as seen
sculptured on the roches perc  es  a remarkable solitary mass of sandstone
on the plains west of manitoba 

i have said that the pentacle has been observed on a figure of anubis 
it would appear to have been well known and highly prized by the early
egyptians  or rather  perhaps  i should say egypto chaldeans  if a recent
writer  mr  robert ballard  is to be believed  he declares that    it is
the geometric emblem of extreme and mean ratio  and the symbol of the
egyptian pyramid  cheops          let a pentacle be formed within a circle 
around the interior pentagon of it describe a circle  around this circle
form a square     then will the square represent the base of cheops    
again  draw two diameters to the outer circle  intersecting at right
angles  and each parallel to a side of the square     then will the parts
of those diameters  between the square and the outer circle  represent
the four apothems of the four slant sides of the pyramid     still again 
connect by lines the angles of the square with the outer circle at the
four points indicated by the ends of the diameters  then    the star of
the pyramid is formed  which  when closed as a solid  will be a correct
model of cheops    

mr  ballard  it is to be feared  like mr  piazzi smyth  has not the
power to perceive coincidences and after thoughts  his book  however  is
decidedly original and interesting 

 illustration  fig        the pentacle and the great pyramid  

i may observe that if the plan of the great pyramid was fashioned after
the pentacle  and mr  proctor be right in saying that it is identical
with    the ordinary square scheme of nativity          the figure of the
astrologers used in casting horoscopes  it follows that the pentacle
furnishes also a key to the latter  then  if it be a fact that the
pyramid was designed by and constructed under the superintendence of
early chaldeans  one has reason to infer that the pentacle was of
oriental origin  probably it was at first a symbol of the sun    a purpose
for which it has been used by different bodies of mystics  and others 

it is interesting to notice that the figure was one of the symbols of
the great hero myth  quetzalcoatl  a light god according to some  but
really  according to reville       a god of the wind  who was generally
represented in the form of a feathered serpent  thus dr  brinton
says     in one of the earliest myths he is called  yahualli ehecatl  
meaning    the wheel of the winds     the winds being portrayed in the
picture writing as a circle or wheel  with a figure with five angles
inscribed upon it  the sacred pentagram  his image carried in the left
hand this wheel  and in the right a sceptre with the end recurved         

the pentacle has been accorded great potency  and used extensively to
keep off witches and all sorts of evil influences  including the devil
himself  and hence it has served purposes very similar to those to which
the horseshoe has often been put  aubrey says that it was formerly
used by the greek christians  as the sign of the cross is now     at the
beginning of letters or books for good luck   s sake            something which
old john evelyn was wont to do in his works  and as southey placed the
puzzling monogram       meant  perhaps  to have similar significance on
the title page of his book     the doctor     one is found in the western
window of the south aisle of westminster abbey  which  doubtless 
the black monks  as they chanted in the choir  often looked on with
superstitious emotion  it may be seen on many a cradle and threshold at
the present day in the fatherland 

the readers of goethe   s great work will remember that dr  faust had one
on his threshold  and that  when he began to perceive that there was
something decidedly suspicious about the character of the    poodle     he
remarked that

       f  r solche halbe h  llenbrut
    ist salomonis schl  ssel gut    

how mephistopheles himself got in was afterward explained by his showing
that one of the angles of the    drudenfuss    was left open 

 illustration  fig        hygeia  a symbol of health  

disciples of the samian sage  cabalistic      jews and arabians  and
others  especially gnostics  long viewed the pentacle as a symbol of
health  and made use of it as an amulet  calling it hygeia  the name of
the goddess of health  it was so called  and to some extent  likely for a
similar reason  regarded as a sacred symbol of health  because it could
be resolved  it was believed  into the greek letters which form the word
hygeia  and these were placed one on each point of the figure       it
was accepted  in fact  as a sort of rebus of the name of the celebrated
daughter of   sculapius  the scholarly and ingenious reader may be able
to trace  more or less definitely  this reputed similarity  it is an
interesting feature of what is certainly a very remarkable figure

        the father of medicine    was  of course  one of the asclepiades  he
was born  it is believed  in the year     b c   and lived to be very old 
his genealogy is preserved in his works  as given in adams    edition  he
is of the fifteenth generation  in a direct line  from   sculapius  he
was of the podalirius branch  in this connection i may remark that  if
hippocrates took the oath of the asclepiades  he must have given it a
decidedly liberal interpretation  for it looks as if he divulged to the
whole world all the mysteries of the healing art of great consequence

serves as a pharmacist   s symbol  he has  probably  bequeathed his name to
the healer of wounds and the like    the surgeon  the word surgeon is from
the latin   chirurgus   or  rather  the french   chirurgien   chirurgeon
has some standing as an english word  the latin   chirurgus   is usually
said to have come from the greek                            a word compounded of
          the hand  and              worker  meaning one who works with the hand 
it seems likely  however  that the name of the centaur                suggested
the application of the word to the surgeon

      herodotus  who visited the country  states that the babylonians
   have no physicians  but when a man is ill they lay him in the public
square and the passers by come up to him  and if they ever had his
disease themselves  or have known any one who has suffered from it  they
give him advice  recommending him to do whatever they found good in
their own case or in the case known to them  and no one is allowed to
pass the sick man in silence  without asking him what his ailment is   
 i        from this it would seem that herodotus might rather have said
that the babylonians were all doctors  or presumed to be  however  it is
thought that jeremiah refers to the practice in lamentations  i      when
he says     is it nothing to you  all ye that pass by  behold and see if
there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow     a similar plan was certainly
practiced elsewhere than in babylonia  strabo says that the egyptians
resorted to it  xvi   and in st  mark it is said that the people    laid

advanced state of knowledge of the various subjects embraced in this
volume  the work seems to me to meet this want admirably    

   the achievements of modern surgery are akin to the marvelous  and dr 
senn has set forth the principles of the science with a completeness
that seems to leave nothing further to be said until new discoveries
are made  the work is systematic and compact  without a fact omitted or
a sentence too much  and it not only makes instructive but fascinating
reading  a conspicuous merit of senn   s work is his method  his persistent
and tireless search through original investigations for additions
to knowledge  and the practical character of his discoveries  this
combination of the discoverer and the practical man gives a special value
to all his work  and is one of the secrets of his fame  no physician 
in any line of practice  can afford to be without senn   s    principles of
surgery           the review of insanity and nervous diseases
